What's up guys! Wanted to give a little love to @bmusiclosangeles who have been teaching Wyatt and Charley for the past few years. Amazing place and all their kids perform live twice a year. Please check them out if your kids want to learn an instrument. Finally @wyattnash15 I ‚ù§U. Nothing makes me happier than watching you play.

You guys know when you go to the beach and you have that one friend who always eats sand? In our group, it’s Aaron. We’ll bring all kinds of delicious food  but nope there’s Aaron, sitting on our blanket just feasting on a ton of sand. And we’re like, “Aaron, sand has no nutritional value!” Sometimes we even have to take him to the hospital and get his stomach pumped! 😂 Tag your friend who eats sand in the comments! 🏖

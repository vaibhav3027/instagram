Brandon and I having a good laugh after he made the joke “Hey look, Jason! You’re dead.” 😂 Brandon and I are good friends and we pretty much joke around like this 24/7.  Brandon is really good at improvising and most of our quips are completely off the cuff.  When we’re together sometimes things get VERY silly.

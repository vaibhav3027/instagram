Rob with his famous hand buzzer gag. I only fell for it nine times! It was quite the SHOCK. LOL. ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚But that's the kind of joking around we do on set. It's a real madhouse. And when Rob takes out the hand buzzers anyone is fair game. (Even someone's grandmother!!) I guess you could say when Rob jokes around I catch a real BUZZ. Ohhhh we have a good time. We really do.

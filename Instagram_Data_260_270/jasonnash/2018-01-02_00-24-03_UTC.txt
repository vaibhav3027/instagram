Happy New Year’s guys! Video of our night in my bio! Here we are about to tear up the town. I tried buy something at Topman like these guys, but none of the clothes fit. So instead I threw on my mom’s workout shirt from Lulu Lemon. Special thanks to Scott for loaning me his gold skull, which really brought the outfit together.

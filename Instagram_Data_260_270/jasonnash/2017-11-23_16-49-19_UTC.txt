Wearing Scotty’s merch and cooking a turkey. Happy Thanksgiving! I’m thankful for Wyatt & Charley, my mom, dad, sister, Marney and Susie.  I’m also especially thankful for the Vlog Squad and how lucky I️ am to work with all these young kids. David, Liza, Scotty, Toddy, Zane, Brandon, Matt, Heath, Carly, Erin, Gabbie and Corinna! Y’all are headed to even bigger things ⭐️ and I️’m thankful to be a part of it.❤️

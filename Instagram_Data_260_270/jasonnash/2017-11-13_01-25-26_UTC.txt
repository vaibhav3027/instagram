We had a great weekend in New York and Boston doing Views Live. Scotty rapped, Toddy stole a girls leg, Matt got blindfolded, Zane told stories about Badoo, Corinna made out with someone onstage and David captained the ship. So thankful to all you guys and if you want to come see us in Chicago over Thanksgiving the link to get tickets is in my bio!

What up kids! (and parents) Wyatt, Charley and I were asked to promote this new book "Make Your Kid a Money Genius (Even If You're Not)‚Äù by @BKobliner. Turns out it's a must-read if you want to start planning for your child's future. I'm so proud of my little ones in this video. I think they did a great job. Now I gotta make sure they don't spend their allowance all in one place. (Link in Bio)

Happy Birthday David and Alex! Scott, sorry you are the only one not killing in this photo. I felt bad when you got back from the bathroom and was like. "Oh man, group picture?!" You tried to save it and jump in. But everybody was already so tired from posing for an entire 45 seconds. I looked at the other pictures but neither me nor Liza looked good in those. I'm sure you can understand my predicament being a big Instagram guy yourself. So again Scott, so sorry you are the only one here looking so so stupid. I still love you and I know you will recover from this.

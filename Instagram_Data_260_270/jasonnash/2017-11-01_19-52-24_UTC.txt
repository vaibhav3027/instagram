I started my new workout routine with celebrity trainer & author Devon Edelman. (“The Living in Your Van Workout" & “Put the Twinkies Down.. and Dip Them in Milk.") Devon’s unorthodoxed training methods have been lauded by fitness experts and professional athletes around the world.  Don't let those peanut butter cups fool you, Devon can dead lift 400 lbs* & once lasted 35 minutes in a steel cage with a grizzly 🐻 as part of Chechnya's highest rated television special ever. After our insane 4 minute workout, Devon instructed us to go inside to replenish the body and cool down.  Right now, Devon doesn't have a bank account so to express my gratitude I bought him some 🍴. When our dog 🐶 Link swiped Devon’s queso there was a good five minutes of screaming and obscenities, but that's because Devon expects nothing but the BEST from the people around him. To get the body I want, Devon says it's going to take a lot of hard work and mental focus, which is why for the next three months he'll be sleeping on my couch. Thank you Devon! The new me starts today!  #workout #fitness #twinkies #NeshtoyatheRabidBear (*drug induced)

I picked this up at the gag store last night and showed it to six of my family members. We all had a hearty laugh but curiously, I kept laughing for the next five minutes! Soon, the paramedics were called as I began to hyperventilate. I dropped to the ground sobbing, flailing my arms, and knocking over a display of edible underwear, while screaming “Who am I?!” In the ambulance 🚑 ,  I apologized to my daughter for ruining her ninth birthday. But I blame it on this gag gift for being TOO darn funny. 😂

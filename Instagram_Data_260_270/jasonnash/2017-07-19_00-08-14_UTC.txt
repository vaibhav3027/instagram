Dating a circus performer was never my first choice. The months on the road, the long distance phone calls, the countless rolls of athletic tape. I'll never forget our times swallowing swords, cleaning the elephant stables and losing our friend to that bear attack. (RIP Squeakers the Clown.) From being a freak in the circus to a freak in the bed. I love walking this "tight rope" with you. My Dearest Arias, these have been the most glorious 10 months of my life and thank you for your delicious cotton candy beard. I could eat you up. ❤️

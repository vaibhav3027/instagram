For the past 20 years, I’ve been working with some of the world’s biggest super models. Flying to different continents, working with top designers & reinventing the beauty standard. My life on 📝 has been something of a dream, but yesterday I learned the true meaning of success, when I met my 20 year-old son Gareth. On our way to Milan, we stopped in Orlando to pick him up. His first words to me were “I haven’t had a proper meal in six days.” We threw a Gucci blanket on him and addressed the cuts on his back. Then we visited a local bookie and paid off most of his debts . (Shoutout to The Molly Crew from St. Cloud! We’re good for the rest!😂) Here we are, wheels up 🛫 feeling fabulous, father and son reunited at last. Believe it or not I’d never heard of Chipotle. So, Gareth, it looks like you’re the one teaching me things already.  Special 🙏 @donatella_versace for the G4.

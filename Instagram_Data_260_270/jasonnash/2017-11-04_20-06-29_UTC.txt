Yo guys! @ATT hooked Charley, Wyatt and I up for a few days with a brand new car powered by super fast AT&T in-car Wi-Fi. We also had tech goodies like tablets, phones and even a Nintendo Switch system! It was a blast trying it all out, and now I can safely say we are the definition of “staying ON the grid.” See the full video! Link in bio. #ad

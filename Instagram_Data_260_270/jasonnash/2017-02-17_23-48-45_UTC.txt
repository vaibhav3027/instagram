Amazing show last night -- my man Wyatt turned me on to TOP and even plays a few of their songs.  Watching him sing all the songs word for word was just about the best thing in the world.  Has anyone else seen them live. If so, how did they do the trick where Tyler Joseph appears in the rafters? (NVIB)

Happy 9th Birthday to my one and only Charley. You make me laugh harder than anyone and you are a great singer. Thank you for being so smart and coming up with ideas for my videos. Everyday you make me realize how wonderful my life is and how important it is that we fight for equality. Not that you need our help, because I have no doubt that you will take over the world. ❤️

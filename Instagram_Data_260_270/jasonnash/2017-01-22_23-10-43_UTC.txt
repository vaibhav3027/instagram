In the morning, she walks downstairs with tussled hair, fresh from a good nights sleep. She yells "Snuggle!" from the couch and I run over there because it is the thing I love most in life. She is like no one else because she can erase any problem with a simple rub of my head and saying "fluffy!" I soak up the her hugs, they give me super human strength. In the car, she belts out 21 Pilots. Her singing has got better and better. So much so she opened a show to 300 people, front and center not a nervous bone in her body. With her brother behind her on guitar,  just 7 years old. It was the best day of my life. Never had to teach her a thing about comedy. Her delivery is unteachable. But what really gets me is that she's always there to help me. I feel guilty, a grown man relying on the perfect timing of 7 year old to pay his bills. How did I get so lucky to get a a savior like this? In her Frozen dress singing Let It Go, at McConnell's falling off a chair, on her butt and laughing. During street hockey showing her athleticism which I wish she would try harder at because she's so darn good. At Fred Segal, which was always my favorite lunch spot, but now hers.  And most of all, her moxie. An inner strength that I know will take her far in life.
What I've learned is that with Charley,  anything is possible.

Happy Birthday, Charley Beans. It is a ride that is just beginning. I love you. And Daddy will always be here.

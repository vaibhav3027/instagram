This is Rachel. Her mom has been Wyatt and Charleyâ€™s nanny since before they were born. We had the pleasure of going to her quinceanera a couple weeks back and I just want to say what an amazing person she is. Rachel excels in school and I know that she is going to be a massive success. Congrats Rachel! Hopefully, one day, I can borrow money from you. ðŸ˜‚

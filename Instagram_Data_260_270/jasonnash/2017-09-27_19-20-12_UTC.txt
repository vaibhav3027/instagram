Had a blast Last night, with Wyatt, Cha Cha and Jack. Wyatt refused to eat any food and had a stomach ache by the end. I was trying to take them home but they really wanted to see the Village People. So by the end of the night he was on the ground holding his side writhing in pain singing ðŸŽ¤YMCA. ðŸ˜‚That pretty much sums up what it's like to take kids to an award show. Got him home and his mom made him a grilled cheese and all was well. Congrats to Liza and David!

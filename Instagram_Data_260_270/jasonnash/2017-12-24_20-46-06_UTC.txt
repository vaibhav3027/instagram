Your uncle whoâ€™s never been married who you see every Christmas, who may be doing illegal things and still lives with your grandmother. He asks you a lot about your friends and if you think any of them would be interested in buying some Chinese cell phones he can get his hands on. Heâ€™s been seeing a woman off and on named Ann Marie for the last 16 years and she may or may not be stopping by for dinner. And heâ€™s excited about Trumpâ€™s tax cuts even though he had no reportable income last year. Merry Christmas, Love Uncle ______. ðŸŽ„

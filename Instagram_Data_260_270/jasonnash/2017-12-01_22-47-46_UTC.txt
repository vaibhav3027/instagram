Today is my one year anniversary on YouTube. Thank you  to all you guys who watch my vlogs.  They are so much fun to make and I wouldnâ€™t want any other job in the world. To anyone struggling, I want to let you know that I tried and failed at so many things in my life and the only reason Iâ€™m still here is because I never quit. Never give up on what youâ€™re passionate about and things will work out. I promise. Love, Jason ðŸ’•

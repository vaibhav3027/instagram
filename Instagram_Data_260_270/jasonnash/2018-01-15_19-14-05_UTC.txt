Happy 12th birthday to my boy Wyatt. You and your sister are the best thing to ever happen to me. You are great at guitar, funny, and kind to everyone you meet.  Everyday, I am baffled as to what I did to deserve a son like you. Keep working hard and the world will be yours. There are no words to describe how much I love you and Iâ€™m sorry Duke was not allowed at the restaurant. Love Dad.

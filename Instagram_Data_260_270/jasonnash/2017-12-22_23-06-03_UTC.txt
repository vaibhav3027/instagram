Hereâ€™s some holiday wishes to my 16 year-old Baxter, whoâ€™s had a tough year moving to a new town. Sure it was hard meeting new friends and it didnâ€™t help that he lit those fires in the woods. But even though heâ€™s got no friends, heâ€™s always got a buddy in me, his mom.  Later today, weâ€™re heading to Dress Barn to find me an outfit for Christmas Day and hopefully grab a soft pretzel ðŸ¥¨. (If his stomach holds up!) Here we are,  two joyous souls getting ready for the most wonderful time of the year! ðŸŽ„

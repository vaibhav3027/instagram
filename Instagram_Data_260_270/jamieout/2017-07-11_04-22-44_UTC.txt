This year, I am hoping to take more opportunities to sleep under the stars, whether in a hammock or just on a sleeping pad. I’ve always been more comfortable sleeping in a tent, but I plan to go beyond what I’ve done before and try something new. Is there anything that will make your outdoor experiences more exciting, more meaningful, or more memorable this year? I would love to hear about it. #WoodsExplorer @WoodsCanada @hashtagpaid

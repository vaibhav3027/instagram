When we arrived at the Taj Mahal, it was clear why it is one of the Seven Wonders of the World.  Unfortunately, when these buildings are under repair, it makes the photos taken a little less inspiring. I’m not a pro at manipulating photos, but thankfully I was able to make a few adjustments in Photoshop after taking a course on Skillshare. If you’re interested in improving your photography, you can get a free 2 month trial if you use the coupon code JAMIEOUT.  I will leave a link in my bio for the next week for those of you who want to check it out. @skillshare #skillshare #sponsor

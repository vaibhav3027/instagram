Every summer as a kid, my family would drive to some random lake and set up camp for a week. I loved the freedom of roaming around and making friends with other kids on their summer vacations. I hope to continue that tradition with my family one day. Iâ€™ve teamed up with SteamWhistle and HBC to share my summer traditions. What are some of your favourite summer traditions? And just a heads up, you can pick up your Hudson Bay Collection + Steam Whistle limited-edition opener in specially-marked cases of SteamWhistle today. #Canada150 @hudsonsbay @steamwhistlebrewing #HBxSW #SteamWhistle #stripespotting #HBCelebrates @hashtagpaid

Two weekends ago I had the honour of hiking with Joel and Delmar, two guys from the Expeditions program put on by @ugmvancouver. Expeditions is a non-profit program designed to help men overcome homelessnes and addiction through the power of nature. It takes men who enroll in UGM’s Alcohol & Drug Recovery Program deep into the backcountry on multi-day treks, reconnecting them to the beauty that surrounds us and giving them new purpose. •

They just put out a really inspiring short documentary with Joel and Delmar in it that I've linked to in my bio. I think you would really be moved by it. For every view and follower to @ugmvancouver a donor will give $3.00 towards helping fund Expeditions. Here's a tangible way for us to help others recover and find wholeness again. Thanks everyone.

The warmer weather and longer evenings have provided a lot more opportunities to get out in the van and enjoy a BBQ with friends. Gotta love this time of year. If youâ€™re looking for something portable that you can take with you to the beach or have in the car, the Weber Q is a great addition. Link to it in my bio to see more details. #ChasingSpring #sponsored @homedepotcanada

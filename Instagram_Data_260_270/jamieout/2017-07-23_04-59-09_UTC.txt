Summer storms over Peyto Lake. As a kid I used to watch the summer storms from inside my uncle's cabin on the lake. I remember the flashes of lightening and boom of thunder while I was wrapped up in a warm blanket inside. Better than any 80s television show at the time. What are your summer storm memories?

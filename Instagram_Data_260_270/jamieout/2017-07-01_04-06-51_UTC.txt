Ever since I visited Lake O'hara for the first time last year, I knew I had to go back. Probably one of the toughest places to book, especially this year being Canada's 150th birthday, but I got a spot again and can't wait to explore this place in the fall. Happy Birthday Canada you beauty. Would love to know if you are heading here this summer.

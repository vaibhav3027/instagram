Hard to comprehend the size of this waterfall. Tim got completely drenched from head to toe standing there to get the photo. Being a bit of a perfectionist, I didn’t get the exact shot I wanted the first time and he went back and got soaked a second time. Now that’s a true friend. It’s a good thing he loves waterfalls.

For the last few days before New Years I want to share with you a few of my favorite hikes from 2017. So if you're making plans for next year around Canada you should add them to your list.
The first is East End of Rundle right outside of Canmore. A shorter day hike, this scramble offers some pretty unique views of Ha Ling peak and 360 degree views of the peaks and valleys below. Bring a friend or two and a headlamp and stay until sunset. You won't regret seeing last light from the top.

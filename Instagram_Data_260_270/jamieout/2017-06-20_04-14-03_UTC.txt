Winter --> Spring was a bit of a slog this year, but I'm excited that the warm weather is finally here to stay in the mountains. Had a fun time #ChasingSpring with @HomeDepotCanada over the past few months, and am excited to use the gear I picked up there for the summer season ahead. What are you excited for this summer?  #sponsored

One last highlight from my 2017 hikes for you all. 
This photo was taken while hiking the Mt Nimbus Via Ferrata in BC. Via Ferrata is simply a hike where you clip into cables along the route, essentially making more difficulty hikes like this one safer and more approachable. To access this hike you need to book a helicopter trip with CMH Heli tours. Definitely a bucket list spot for me.

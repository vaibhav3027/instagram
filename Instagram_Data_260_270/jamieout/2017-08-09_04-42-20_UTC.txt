Iâ€™m excited to be working with Canon Canada as part of their #One2Watch program and showcasing more about how I take my photos and the gear that I use. 
This photo was taken using a Canon 5d Mark III and 16-35mm F2.8 II lens at Maligne Lake in Alberta. @CanonCanada #ShotOnCanon.  If you have any questions about camera gear, fire away in the comments below.

On this particular night I stayed up watching the full moon rise from behind the mountains and couldn’t believe I was the only one witnessing it at that time from this spot.  This edit was inspired by my good friend @bryanadamc and his behind the scenes videos.  If you’re looking for some new inspiration, go check out his work. Hope you like it.

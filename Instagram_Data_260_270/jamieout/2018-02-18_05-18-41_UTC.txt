Places like this still exist in a pristine state because someone decided it was valuable to protect. Our BC parks system is the largest provincial system in Canada, and yet it is one of the worst funded per-hectare in the country.
•
This needs to change. We need to #StandUpForParks to ensure adequate funding to maintain the integrity of our parks, hire enough park rangers and conservation officers to look after them, and provide visitors with a positive experience.

Sign the petition in my bio if you’re interested in helping keep our parks pristine for future generations to come.

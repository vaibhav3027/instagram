Currently traveling back from the land of Israel.  The landscapes of this country are incredibly diverse. From the vast Mars like deserts to the aqua marine shorelines of the Mediterranean, it's hard to explain how impactful this trip was.  If you ever get a chance to see it yourself, I would highly recommend it. Have you ever traveled in the Middle East? Would love to hear about your experience. #socality #israelcollective

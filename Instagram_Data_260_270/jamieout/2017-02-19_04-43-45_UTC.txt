For those that weren't up able to see my recent instastories, I just got back from an 8 day journey around the world with some great friends, exploring some places I had only dreamt of seeing before. Hope you enjoy some of the shots from the trip and are inspired to get out and explore some of them. If you have any questions about places, feel free to ask, but I think most will be pretty obvious. ðŸ˜‰

Next up on my list of favorite hikes from this year was Tunnel Bluffs above Howe Sound. The trailhead is only 40 minutes from Vancouver, but it feels like you're a long way from anything. I recommend camping in the spring or later into the fall and midweek if you can, to avoid crowds.
As always, please respect these beautiful places and pack out what you pack in.

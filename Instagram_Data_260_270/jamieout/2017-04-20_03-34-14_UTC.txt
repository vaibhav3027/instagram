I just recently read a post on my good friends' blog @thenaturopathsdaughters that said this: Supporting another's success won't ever dampen yours. Comparison truly is the thief of joy.  It is so easy to compare yourself to others ... from careers to parenting, kids, body shapes, health, gifts, talents, lifestyles... I've been guilty of this and it quickly robs you of joy. So go out and learn from the amazing, empowering, men and women in your life and refuse to compare your bloopers reel to everyone else's highlights reel.

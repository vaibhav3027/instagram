On a whirlwind trip right now for the next 10 days. First stop was Iceland, which was such a wild place. We got destroyed by the weather though. 100km winds and rain blowing sideways. Still tried to capture the beauty of the country, and thankful to @aetherapparel jackets for keeping us dry. The rain halted a few of our plans, but it's just an excuse to come back to see more. Follow along on stories to see this trip unfold. #sp

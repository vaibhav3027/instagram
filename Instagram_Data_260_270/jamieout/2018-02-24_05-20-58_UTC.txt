Hey Friends! Exciting news to share with you. I have teamed up with some close friends to share a new resource about great travel spots and tips with you. @travelandcampcollective •
If you’re interested in learning more about paddling to Spirit Island for example, (the location in the above photo) I’ve written a post about it on the website. Check my bio for the link to the article. Also use #travelandcamp to share your favourite places with us and to be featured.

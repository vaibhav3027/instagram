Wasssuppp Instagram! Andy & I heard about the blizzard and decided to get up at 5am to start shooting. Here's a recap! Full video in the bio.

So I realized I've been uploading more vlogs and cinematic videos rather than makeup, but I promise I'll find a balance between the two. I know I have my supporters who will watch and support anything I upload, but then again I understand that there are subscribers who are here solely just for makeup. Ever since this move I've been a lot more adventurous and eager to shoot new content because I remember a lot of people telling me that the makeup tutorials were getting repetitive so I wanted to add a new element to my channel. I'm not saying I'm going to quit makeup, but I've grown to love doing these videos as well, so I hope you can grow to love both sides of me (as cheesy as that sounds lol). With that being said, I hope you enjoy this video. I'll be back to doing makeup sooner than you think! üôèüèº Thanks @andyto for always helping me ‚ù§

So sad to be leaving already, but I just wanted to thank @united for the incredible opportunity to be apart of the inaugural launch of their new nonstop route from Houston to Sydney! Will definitely have to come back to explore the rest of Australia as well as Houston! Canâ€™t wait to start editing the vlog. Until then, find me knocked out for the next 17 hours trying to recover from this sickness ðŸ˜­ #unitedjourney

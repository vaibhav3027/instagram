Oh you know, just my everyday makeup routine 😂 jk! Went to @VisitSuzhou and I instantly fell in love!! They call it the Venice of China because of their beautiful canals running through the city and romantic atmosphere. The other day, we visited the Kunqu Opera House and got to see opera being performed the traditional Chinese way! This particular storyline is similar to Shakespeare’s Romeo & Juliet, and I got to dress up as the main character whom is considered very elegant (swipe over to see my elegant performance). This was so special to me because I’ve always seen this on tv as a child and it meant so much to experience it first hand. If you’re still reading, let me know something unique about your culture! Would love to learn about them ❤️ #visitsuzhou #mychinaexperience #lifewelltravelled

First day in Nanjing 🇨🇳 We spent the day visiting tombs of past emperors, being in places I once learned about in history class (so surreal!), and saw some beautiful plum / cherry blossoms. This picture was captured at the Confucius Temple which was one of my favorite spots of the day. I was blown away by the food vendors, shops and how lively it was with all of the lanterns lighting the night 🏮✨ @gotonanjing @cathaypacific #mychinaexperience

Hi, my name is Trey and I have a basketball game tomorroooow (if you get this reference you a real one ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚) Jk, on a serious note: I love how colorful Hong Kong is ðŸŒˆ This is at Choi Hung and it is one of Hong Kongâ€™s oldest public estates. So sad to be leaving this place so soon. I was getting used to my peeps and the amazing food ðŸ˜«

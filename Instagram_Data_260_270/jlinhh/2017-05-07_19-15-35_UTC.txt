I've always loved drinking tea, but my recent trip to London made me even crazier about it. I tried matcha tea for the first time out there and I've been obsessed ever since. As soon as I got back to New York I discovered a tea spot called Ippodo where I was able to learn the difference between low and high grade matcha, and I even bought the kit with the special bamboo whisk to make myself a cup every morning! Lol. After doing more research on Yelp I came across this spot called @physicalgraffitea in the east village and it's already my second time here this week ðŸ˜…. They offer over 200 types of teas and if you're looking for a peaceful getaway from the busy city then this is your place! I'm drinking their infamous matcha latte, but if you're not a fan of matcha I would definitely recommend any of the other green teas or oolong teas ðŸ˜‹ If you read til the end -- Are you team tea or coffee? If tea, what's your favorite?

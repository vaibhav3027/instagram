Prior to this trip, I had no idea Nanjing existed, but itâ€™s safe to admit Iâ€™ve learned way more than I ever did in history class being here for the past three days. Here in Nanjing, you not only have their cultural background, but their beautiful cityscape, their lush green mountains, amazing people and food. Every place had something to offer and Iâ€™m so grateful to have been given the opportunity to see this city. Fun fact: Nanjing was the capital of China for 10 dynasties before Beijing! Biggest thank you to @GoToNanjing, @TourGuideJean, @CathayPacific and Nanjing Tourism. Next stop: Suzhou aka the Venice of China ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡³ #GoToNanjing #MyChinaExperience #LifeWellTraveled

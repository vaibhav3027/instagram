Way too hot for makeup today... except brows of course ðŸ˜‚ I kinda wanna try microblading my brows + getting lash extensions. Have you guys done it? Do you like it? I also stumbled across this super cute cafe / bakery while exploring Williamsburg today! Check out my latest blog to see the pictures -- dearjoycelyn.com ðŸŒ»

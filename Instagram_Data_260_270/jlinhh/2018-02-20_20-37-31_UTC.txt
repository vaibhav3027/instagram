Yesterday we drove around Oakland with the intentions of shooting a YouTube video and instead I saw my younger self as we were passing through restaurants, liquor stores, schools and neighborhoods. To be honest with you guys, I used to resent Oakland. I felt ashamed every time someone asked where I was from, but there was a moment of clarity for me during this cruise. I finally understood. After dropping Andy off, I started to get emotional as I was driving my usual route home and ended up crying during the ride. So many memories lie within these streets and I felt every single emotion I once felt when I lived here â€” sad, heartbroken, angry, happy, excited. Iâ€™m grateful for the memories, the people, the hardships and the growth. I wouldnâ€™t be the person I am today without Oakland and Iâ€™m proud to say that. If you read through this, thank you. Comment where youâ€™re from ðŸ™‚

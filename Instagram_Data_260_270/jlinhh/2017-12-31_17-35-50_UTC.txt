Happy happy happy. 😄 Never would i ever imagine I’d be where i am today. Growing up in Oakland, California and being one of the most doubtful and biggest critic i know, i always thought I’d be there forever. I’ve been told so many times that pursuing this “social media thing” wasn’t gonna work out. All thanks to @andyto and the support of my followers / subscribers i was able to move to New York City this year, travel to 8 countries, 8 states and finally be able to afford to buy my family nice gifts for Christmas. It’s been a dream come true, and i thank you guys from the bottom of my heart because without your support none of this would’ve been possible. So incredibly grateful for all the new friends I’ve made this year and the opportunities I’ve been given. Cheers to the best year of my life thus far. Happy New Years 🥂 Have fun and be safe wherever you are ❤️

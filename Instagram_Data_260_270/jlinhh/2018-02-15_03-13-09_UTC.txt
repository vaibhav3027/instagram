@andyto surprisingly picked both our outfits today haha what do you think?!? We were shopping at Zara last night and I found this blazer dress in red as well as his coat in a red/navy colorway, but he wanted to be different so he chose yellow for us instead. Betrayed my favorite color, but I guess he did alright or whateva 😂❤️ | 📸: @zeekyan

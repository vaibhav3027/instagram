Selamat pagi, Indonesia 🇮🇩 The jet lag has been sooo real as it's literally a 12 hour time difference from New York 😭 Also, I've been getting eaten alive by mosquitoes!! Both of my ankles are swollen to the point where I now have cankles and it hurts to even walk 😫 Other than that I can't and shouldn't be complaining. I'm just grateful to be here experiencing this insanely beautiful and humbling country. Can't wait to share more with you guys 🙏🏼 Dress from @lolashoetique 💃🏼

As I sit here on my flight back home wishing I were here instead, I can't help but reflect on the last two weeks here in Indonesia with tears streaming down my face. Thank you so much @iwwm for showing me this incredible country and letting me experience it in the most cultural way possible. Thank you to my new friends for some of the most unforgettable memories of my life and giving me a glimpse of life outside all the bs back in the states lol. I wish I could've stayed longer to see it all. So much of myself has changed in the last two weeks and you've all inspired me to someday be able to venture off alone with just a backpack on my back. Last but not least, thank you to @andyto for making this all possible for our 7 years. This was one of my favorite trips to date. I'm gonna miss this so much 😪 See you later, Indonesia 🇮🇩❤️ Vietnam next month, @malantran? #kamandalu #ubud #JlinhhsRedDress

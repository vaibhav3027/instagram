"I... can be apart of the scuba squad?" Who knows that reference? ðŸ˜‚ On a more serious note, this is probably the first picture @andyto & I has taken together in months. Thank you for all that you do for me, like coming home before the sun sets to take #ootd's of me or putting toothpaste on my toothbrush so that it'll be ready when I wake up (lmao). I appreciate you so much and I can't even begin to tell you how proud I am of you. He's been cookin up some serious heat at @beautifuldestinations -- can't wait for you guys to see the video! Those guys are so inspiring. | Thank you @tomjauncey for capturing this photo. You're awesome!!

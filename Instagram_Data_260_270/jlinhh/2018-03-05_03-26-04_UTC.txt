#lostfiles | My anxiety was at an all time high this weekend and I don’t know why lol. I didn’t wanna leave my apartment cause I was afraid of my doorman seeing me (& secretly judging me?!?), and I didn’t wanna postmates food because they always have to call to let you know the delivery person is on its way up lmao. Instead I ate a box of Cheerios (with no milk cause I didn’t have any) and some top ramen hahahaha the struggle omfg. Does this ever happen to you guys???

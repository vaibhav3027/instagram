Just wanted to take a second to share what me and @andyto’s travel photos and videos looked like when we first started in 2012. I get a lot of comments from aspiring content creators saying they’re waiting to start a YouTube channel when they can afford to get the best camera or lights, but as Andy always says, “the best camera is the one you have on you.” We didn’t have access to the best equipment at the time, so we used what we had. A lot of the footage in our Hawaii video was actually filmed with our iPhone 4 at the time. Andy recently filmed an entire travel video using solely his iPhone X and it was mainly to show everyone that it’s possible to create amazing content with what you have—whatever that is! The last clip is a video from our latest vlog to show you that with hard work and a lot of practice, you will get better! Don’t be afraid of trying new things and stepping out of your comfort zone. It’s all part of growing! If anything you should be afraid of not changing! If your goal is to create, pick up whatever you have & just try! We all start somewhere ❤️ P.s. who else eats hot Cheetos with salami??

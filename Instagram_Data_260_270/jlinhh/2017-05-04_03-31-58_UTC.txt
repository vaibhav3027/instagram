My London vlog is now uploaded on my YouTube channel. I spent so long working on this edit & I'm so proud to say I filmed and edited everything entirely on my own. Usually when I travel, I always have @andyto carrying the equipment and helping me film the cinema stuff, but I was completely on my own this trip. I must say carrying a 15lbs backpack everyday was definitely a struggle. My shoulders ached every single day, but it was so worth it after seeing what I was able to create. I'd do it again in a heartbeat. Aside from that, a lot of crazy sh*t happened while I was in London as you'll see in the vlog. As traumatizing as it was, I don't think I'd let it stop me from traveling again. You can't live life in fear, otherwise you'll be missing out on so much. Hope you guys like the vlog. The link to the full video is in my bio 🙏🏼

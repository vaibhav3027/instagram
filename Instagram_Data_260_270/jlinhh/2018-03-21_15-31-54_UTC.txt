Good morning from the Great Wall of China 🇨🇳 I’ve always wanted to see this place and it was even more surreal in person ✨ Huge thank you to @rosewoodbeijing for the amazing stay during our time in Beijing. You guys have to check out their property if you ever find yourself there. Their restaurants and accommodations were beyond amazing 🙏🏼 P.s. ya girl was freeeeezing but had to do it for the gram (& my parents lmao) #JlinhhsRedDress

Andy walked through this pond full of fish poop just to set up the tripod for this shot lmao worth or nah? Anyways, who would've thought two broke 16 and 18 year olds from Oakland (clueless as to what they'd be doing with their lives) would now be living in New York City with their dream jobs traveling the world 7 years later. Don't get me wrong though, we still go through our struggles, but I'm so incredibly thankful and honored to have grown alongside him these past years. Cheers to 7 years, @andyto 👲🏻

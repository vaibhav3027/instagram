Lower Antelope Canyon was one of those places that exceeded all of my expectations. Itâ€™s even more beautiful in person and to even think something like this is natural is insane. No complaints or mishaps for this shot, so I would say itâ€™s 100% worth it!!! Okay maybe my dress did get dirty from dragging it along the dirt but 10/10 would still recommend ðŸ˜‚ #JlinhhsRedDress

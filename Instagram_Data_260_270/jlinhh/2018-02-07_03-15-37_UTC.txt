Excited to say Iâ€™m finally getting Lasik in about two weeks after being damn near blind for 12 years. My vision is so terrible that faces are a complete blur unless Iâ€™m 5 inches from your face, seriously (without contacts on, of course). Will be vlogging the entire process and answering all of your questions so stay tuned. Looking forward to feeling like a new woman lmao until then, enjoy this selfie of me with makeup on and my hair done because Iâ€™m not allowed to wear contacts from here on out so Iâ€™ll just be hiding away until I can see again ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚

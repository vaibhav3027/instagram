Good morning ✌🏼 Woke up at 4:30am this morning to shoot the bean but it was storming so there wasn't much of a sunrise and we ended up getting kicked out due to lightning.. but I somehow managed to get some footage & pictures!😁 Happy Monday, everyone! Have a good day 🌻 | Thanks @fschicago #fschicago!

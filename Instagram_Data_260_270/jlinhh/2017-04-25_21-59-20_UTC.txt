Today was such an exhausting day. We had a red eye flight last night and the entire flight I was elbowed by the person next to me every 5 minutes and the person behind me kept kicking my chair so I barely got to sleep ðŸ™ƒ Once we got off the plane we went straight to starting our itinerary but luckily we had afternoon tea to pick ourselves up. Got to do some cool cinema today for next weeks vlog! Can't wait to show you guys. Finally back at the airbnb now, so it's time to finally get some sleep and start another long day tomorrow ðŸ˜…

Had so much fun creating this video in partnership with @uber for the launch of their new #UberBike with @jumpbikes_us! I got to blend in with the locals and visit all of my favorite places while riding their electric-assisted bike! Be sure to find an e-bike in the Uber app and keep an eye out for the red Uber Bikes around San Francisco! What are some of your favorite places to explore in the city? #ad #WhereTo http://ubr.to/2H6Nysa

Lately I’ve been finding myself meeting new people who’d ask if I have an Instagram or YouTube and I’ll say things like, “yeah but it sucks” or “yeah but my engagement is shit.” And I think it’s because I was more focused on the destination rather than the journey. It wasn’t until today when I was going through my Dropbox of old pictures where I realized how much work I’ve actually put in to get where I am today. If you’ve been feeling this way then take a step back to analyze all that you’ve done and give yourself some credit because you deserve it. Instead of being so negative towards myself, I want to focus more on appreciating the process of creating such as the people involved or the struggle that went on behind every picture or video you see on my page. Not sure if that made any sense, but stop doubting yourself and appreciate the journey

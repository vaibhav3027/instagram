Growing up in the Bay Area and now living in New York, I love being able to come home and be a tourist in my own hometown. Thanks to @uber and @jumpbikes_us, I used the new #UberBike to get to all of my favorite places in town such as Potrero Hill. It's one of my favorite photography spots and I can bike there without worrying about the steep hills thanks to the electric-assist. One of my favorite memories as a child was riding my bike around Lake Merritt every day after dinner, so it felt nice to be on a bike again and see the city from a new perspective! Be sure to find an e-bike in the Uber app and keep an eye out for the red Uber Bikes around San Francisco! #WhereTo #sponsored http://ubr.to/2H6Nysa

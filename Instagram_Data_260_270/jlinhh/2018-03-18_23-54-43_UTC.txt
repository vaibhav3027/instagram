Until next time, Suzhou aka the Venice of China! 🇨🇳 This trip was definitely one for the books. To be quite honest with you guys, I used to be ashamed of being part Chinese because many people always made fun of it growing up. I’m extremely grateful to be given the opportunity to come here and learn more about my culture. Even though my parents didn’t grow up in China, it meant so much to be able to experience the history first hand. Aside from that, I’m so thankful to have met such incredible and humble people during this trip that made the experience that much better @nastasiaspassport, @andyto, @gabemedeiros_, @visitsuzhou 🙏🏼✨ Next stop: Beijing!

This picture was taken at Tongli Water Town and it was one of my favorite places here in Suzhou. You could feel the energy steaming through the corridor and canals. It was truly an incredible experience. Thank you to our tour guide, Wendy for helping me find my dream dress and making sure no other boats were in this shot. Last but not least, thank you to Nastasia, Gabe, and Andy for running around the streets to make sure we were able to capture this moment. Worth it or nah?

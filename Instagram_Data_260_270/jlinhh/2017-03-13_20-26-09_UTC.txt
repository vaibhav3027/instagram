(Full video in the bio!) Despite the painful cold weather, one thing I loved about moving to New York was the thought of starting new and not knowing anyone here (except one cousin who I still have to visit lmao)! It forced me out of my comfort zone and it made me more eager to go out, explore on my own and meet new people. I'm growing to love this city in different ways than I did when I was just visiting and I hope to keep capturing the energy through these weekly vlogs. Everything was shot & edited by both me and @andyto ðŸ˜Š Hope you like it!

Tricep Pushdowns - One of the founding movements of any bodybuilding arm workout. This exercise has been the staple in my workout routine for the past 10+ years.
-
You can perform this exercise with a rope attachment, straight/ez bar, single arm, etc.
-
During this workout I did 2-3 drop sets for every working set. I don't go usually go into a set with a number in mind.. Why stop at 8 reps if you could do 12 ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”

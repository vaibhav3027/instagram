CONSISTENCY

I want to pass on some advice that has had the biggest impact in creating my physique. This is knowledge I've accumulated from over a decade of my own research and refinement by trial and error.

I really can't stress enough how important understanding TIME can be when striving to create the perfect physique. I've seen people train for a couple months, get discouraged by their slow progress, and quit before really ever seeing what they're capable of achieving. If you want to be a bodybuilder, you start down a thousand mile road, and you have begun a marathon, not a sprint. But if you consistently train/eat correctly you'll maximize your potential and drastically speed up your journey.

Bent Over Barbell Rows ðŸ”¥
-
If you can wait through the first 30 seconds of le douche you can see me doing some barbell rows. Iâ€™m doing more of a Dorian Yates style row here by locking it in a lil higher up instead of trying to keep the back parallel with the floor. Youâ€™ll be way stronger by having a more upright posture.
-
I also try to bring the bar to my bellybutton in a fluid motion without a bunch of swinging/jerking. Consciously incorporate the divine nature of mind muscle connection and youâ€™ll be good to go.

Be sure you keep those shoulder blades retracted and give it a try ðŸ˜‰

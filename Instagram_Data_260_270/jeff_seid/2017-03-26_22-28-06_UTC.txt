My favorite muscle group is by far chest ðŸ˜Ž I've always thought a huge plate-body looking chest was the most aesthetic muscle group. Unfortunately not everyone is born with epic chest genetics.. I definitely wasn't ðŸ˜³ But after years of hard work and perfecting my chest routine I've turned my weakest muscle group into one of my strongest.

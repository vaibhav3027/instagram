When it comes to bodybuilding my strongest muscle group has always been my back. After the first five years of training I began to realize my back was a dominant muscle group, so I started to focus on other muscle groups more heavily. Since proportions is always a key factor in aesthetics this is a great realization to have but don't think you can slack off on your strong points. Around 19 I started to rely more heavily on genetics and stopped training my back so intensely. After a couple years my back started to fall behind my other muscle groups.. I observed this flaw and of course changed my training. Always remember hard work beats talent when talent doesn't work hard.

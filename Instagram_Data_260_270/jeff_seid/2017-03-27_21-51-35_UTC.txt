KEEP THE BAN ON HUNTING HIBERNATING BEAR & WOLF FAMILIES
-
The House of Representatives just voted to allow hunters to kill bears hibernating with their young. If their decision passes into law, hunters will be allowed to enter dens where bears are hibernating and kill their entire families. They would also be allowed to shoot and kill wolf families, including their pups.

Slaughtering entire families of hibernating bears is cowardly and inhumane. Bears pose no danger to humans or livestock when they're sleeping through the winter. Culling wolf families is a short-sighted plan that will push their numbers toward extinction again.

There is still hope to protect bears and wolves from this barbaric slaughter. Please sign the petition to urge United States Senators to vote against this resolution!

* From the National Parks: "We are sad to report... the Senate voted 52-47 to remove protections for wildlife in Alaska. The bill overturns protections for wildlife in our National Wildlife Refuges in Alaska. One protection these bills overturn is allowing the killing of wolf pups and bear cubs in and around their dens, even by means of gassing dens. It also allows "hunters" to use aircraft's to hunt bears.

Just finished the St. Jude 5k run 😁 Incredible turn out of 10,000 people!! Pretty cool to see so many people coming together to support a great cause, felt good to be apart of something special like this. I ended up placing top 10 lol had a lot of energy in the end and kicked a little late cause I didn't know when the finish line was lmfao -.- First time running a 5k, my time was about 20 minutes. It's not about competition tho at something like this but I'm a competitive kent lol

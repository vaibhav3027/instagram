Meet Bobby Pandour, he was born in 1876. Bobby was a champion gymnast who had credited building his physique by using 10lbs dumbbells and swore off heavy lifting.. He also stated he would carry his brother up stairs to grow his legs. So how did he build such an impressive physique if he didn’t have any knowledge of training science or nutrition? The haters will scream steroids!! Well during his days steroids weren’t even invented yet lmao so stfu. Also imagine if this picture were taken on a DSLR camera of today instead of a potato of a camera.. If Bobby Pandour would have actually had proper equipment to train with or some real knowledge on how to build muscle his physique would have been heaps more impressive. So if Bobby could build an aesthetic physique naturally back in the 1800s, why couldn’t someone nowdays with good equipment, real knowledge on training/nutrition and even better genetics build one now?

Listen this post isn’t made to bash people who use roids or to promote natural bodybuilding. Everyone can do whatever the fuck they want with their bodies. The point of this post is to prove to people out there that it is possible to build an impressive physique with hardwork. Nowadays it seems like almost everyone thinks someone with a good physique is on roids lmao. Stop setting your standards so low!! Stop with your fucking excuses!! We are all on this earth for a short period of time so let’s make the most out of life. Instead of hating how about we support one another. You gotta look in the mirror and ask yourself if you’re living to your full potential. Rant over.

When it comes to building a physique it is essential that your body have an anabolic diet to build and grow muscle. That's why it's so important to have proper nutrition. This is the foundation of any great bodybuilder. It doesn't matter if you track your macros, follow a meal plan, guesstimate or whatever method you choose to follow - all that matters is that you get the food you need into your body. Period.

The average gym goer does not realize how important nutrition is when trying to build muscle. You need to follow a good workout program, of course, but training hard will not be enough. When you tear down your muscle fibers, your body rebuilds to be stronger and to do so, it must be well nourished by a proper diet.

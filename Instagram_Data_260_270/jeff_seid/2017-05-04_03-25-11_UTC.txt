Lately I've been getting asked multiple times a day what my workout routine is and any kind of workout advice I can give. So I figured I should write something up to help everyone out!

Check out the workout routine that I'm currently following and you should try out also. The workout is on my website jeffseid.com. Let me know what ya think! Should I write up more articles?? If so what kind of topics?!

On September 23rd I will be participating in the St. Jude 5k Run to End Childhood Cancer, and I need you to help me reach my fundraising goal. Support me by making a donation at the link in my bio. Any amount will help St. Jude save lives.

Why St. Jude?
* Thanks to our supporters, families never receive a bill from St. Jude for anything.
* St. Jude has helped push the overall survival rate for childhood cancer from less than 20% when we first opened our doors to 80% today. St. Jude won't stop until no child dies from cancer.

Wide Grip Pull-Ups
-
By far the best exercise for building up width. This is the movement I’ve used to build my lats and to give the highly desired V taper. Although this is a pretty basic exercise, I’ve always believed the fundamentals are the most important in building your physique. Most people overthink bodybuilding and always coming up with funky looking workouts.. Just stick to the basics brah it’s not rocket science. Here’s some tips to incorporate next time you do pull-ups:
-
✅ RETRACT SHOULDER BLADES (if you aren’t affectively targeting the working muscle you’re wasting your time)
✅ Try doing different rep tempos (slow eccentric or concentric reps, pause reps, weighted reps, drop sets, etc)
✅ Switch up your hand grip
✅ If you can’t do body weight, start with the assisted machine (do them as your first exercise)
✅ If you want pure strength gain do longer rest periods

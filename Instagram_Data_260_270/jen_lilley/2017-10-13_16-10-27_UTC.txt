If #mfamovie is playing in a theater near you (see third slide for locations), please go see it. It's raw and sobering. You will laugh and cry and be shocked and outraged. It's what a movie should be.  It tells a story and leaves you thinking. Then comment below on how it impacted you. Full discretion, this movie is not kid friendly.  Thank you @mikecmanning for creating this wonderful film!

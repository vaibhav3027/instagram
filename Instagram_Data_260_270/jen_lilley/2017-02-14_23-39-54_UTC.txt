Need a laugh!?! This is me hopped up on sugar during my #adashoflove photo shoot with @bradeyoungphoto. I don't even know what I'm saying... I think I was going for..."the best part about being an adult is you can eat sugar when you want..."but then I started shaking from all the sugar in my blood stream. Mom help! Hahahaha! #gigglemonster now you know what poor @brndnpnny had to put up with between takes :)

Thank you @davidarquette for lending your voice and talent to #SoldLA benefitting @ecpat. 
I am confident that if people were informed about the world's dirty secret of #humantrafficking, there would be far more opposed to this heinous crime than there are greedy exploiters who are okay with enslaving and selling women, men, and children for sex. We CAN end this. But we have to stand TOGETHER! Visit soldthemovie.com and get involved!

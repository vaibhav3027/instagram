Throwback to when I had my longer hair (I miss it) and when Doug first surprised me with this beautifully designed (he designed it himself!!) Spooning Hearts necklace. You guys know we love spooning - it's what helped us grow closer, fall in love, and stay in love when we were first #marriedatfirstsight. This design is a big spoon and little spoon spooning together and their spoon handles join to create one heart. My hubby said that it's a representation of us spooning together and our hearts being one. 💓 Oh he can be so romantic and lovely!!!🤗 I adore this necklace. It's on my site (link in bio) and on SALE [$99.99] for a limited time (until they're out of stock.) You can order 14K gold plated or 100% genuine Sterling silver. They're handmade in NEW YORK CITY. And Bc I love all my #Frans you can use code FREESHIPPING for free shipping (on any item on my site) ... but I can't keep this offer up forever so hurry before it's gone. ❤ P.S. Include a note w your order Bc I love getting to know my customers. 💞💓#happyvalentinesday #valentinesdaygift #giftforher #handmadejewelry #jewelry

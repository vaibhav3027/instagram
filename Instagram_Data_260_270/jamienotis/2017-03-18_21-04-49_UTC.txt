I may be 17 weeks pregnant, but I am still in the awkward stage where I'm not full blown big belly pregnant, but I definitely can't fit into my normal clothes. I've been trying to find cute outfits that I can wear while #pregnant and even after I have my baby.👶🏼🌈 I am in LOVE with this dress from Express. It's cute and flows nicely, but it also accentuates my growing #bump.🤰🏼 I've recently joined with @liketoknow.it... so for those of you who are always asking what I'm wearing now I can finally share it in a super easy way with you!🤗🎉 All you have to do is screenshot this pic to get more details! (You do have to download the like to know it app if you haven't dont that already....)😘💫 #OOTD #liketkit http://liketk.it/2qJUb  #growbabygrow #babybump #fashion #maternity

Hopefully we’ll have some exciting news for you guys soon - we’re working on making this girlie a big sister!👶🏼🎀 This is TMI, but first we have to get everything correct downstairs - it stillll hurts when we're intimate.🙈 When we were trying to get pregnant with Gracie I was peeing on sticks All. The. Time.🤦🏻‍♀️ I don't wanna be all stressed peeing on sticks and waking up early every day to take my temperature this time around - instead, we’re using the @avawomen bracelet. Ava tracks nine physiological parameters to tell you your most fertile days each cycle in real-time. Ava’s actually proven to DOUBLE your chances of conceiving each month! We’re so excited to meet baby #2 (my aunt told me she had a dream I'm pregnant with #2 & 
it's a boy!!! ...not humanly possible bc *it* hasn't been happening buuuut I'm hoping *it* will stop hurting and baby #2 is in our near future!)🙏🏻 If you want more info on Ava just go to Avawomen.com and as always, I asked for a code for my frans. Use my code JAMIEO for $20 off your own #avabracelet.💘

I wanna wish my mother in law a very happy birthday!🎈She’d give the shirt off her back to anyone in need ... and then she’d Invite you over for dinner.😂 (True story! She invites everyone over for dinner. lol.) I’m so thankful she raised such a kind, loving, caring and funny man who I get to call hubby!💗 And she’s seriously the best grandma in the whole wide world.🌍 Happy B-day Super Bon Bon!💘 #happybirthday #birthdaygirl

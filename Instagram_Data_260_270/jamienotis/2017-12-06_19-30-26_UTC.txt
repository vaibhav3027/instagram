I remember the first time I went shopping for my very own daughter.☺️ This was the first outfit I ever bought her.💗 It was so surreal to put her in it & go to the park when she was a newborn. ....And now she’s grown so healthy & big that she won’t fit in it.😻 Time really does fly. I’m cherishing every single moment.👶🏼🌈 #babybump #readytopop #bump

I love when she sleeps while momma shops!👶🏼😴🙌🏼 ...I’ll be shoppin’ for new, spring sunglasses tomorrow because @diffeyewear is having a MASSIVE sale where you can get up to 50% off! And they still send a pair of reading glasses to someone in need for every purchase!☺️ Feels better shopping there where I know they give back, but target runs for the basics are always a must too.💁🏼‍♀️ Lol if you need new Spring sunnies don’t miss out!😎 Spring sunnies on sale for me, free reading glasses for someone in need - win, win!😍 #DIFFpartner #diffeyewear #DIFFday PS Doug snapped this pic a couple weeks ago when Gracie still hung out in her car seat. Now I put her in the front seat of the cart. Gah, she’s getting so big!💘

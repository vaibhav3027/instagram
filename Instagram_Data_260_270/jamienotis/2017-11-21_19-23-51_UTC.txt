How surreal to see my baby’s nursery in this week’s @lifeandstyleweekly mag.💗 It took me MONTHS to get @henleygracehehner room all set up - and I couldn’t have done it without my family and friends .... and honestly, i couldn’t have done it without my Frans!❤️ I told them all about how you guys have been so supportive too ... you guys have sent Gracie so many sweet & thoughtful gifts - thank you SO MUCH.😍 I couldn’t have made her room this beautiful without you..🤗 Do you like how her nursery turned out?💜 #thankyou #nursery #babygirl #lifeandstyle | 📷: @aliblakephotography

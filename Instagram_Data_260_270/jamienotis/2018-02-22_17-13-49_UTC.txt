Gracie is S I X months old today!💫 As much as I want her to stay my little baby forever it's sooo fun watching her grow up & experience new things! She had so much fun going down the slide for the first time yesterday! It was 75 yesterday!☀️ And omg my birthing hips got stuck halfway down 🤷🏻‍♀️ But at least I look cute in my @diffeyewear sunnies!😎 You guys know I love these sunglasses bc for every pair sold they donate a pair of reading glasses to someone in need.☺️ So I feel like I’m giving back when I get a new pair.💗 And you guys know I always try to get you a discount - you can use code JOTISDIFF if you want new sunnies & to give back.💁🏼‍♀️ I'm wearing the Becky. OH, and guyyyys, today we have the sweet momma @jadelizroper joining us for #momsunfiltered. It’s at 1EST right here on my insta.💃🏻#DIFFpartner #makeaDIFFerence #itfeelsgood #diffeyewear

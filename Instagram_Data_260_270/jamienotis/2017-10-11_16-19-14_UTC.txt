Thank you ALL for helping me choose the best pic for Henley’s birth announcement cards!💗 Comment a 🙋🏻 if you picked this photo!☺️ I ordered custom cards from @plymouthcards because I LOVE the way you can put real photos inside the card and they’re ready for a 5X7 frame☺️ - Because let’s be honest, most cards aren’t framable (is that even a word?)🤔 so they’re tossed in the garbage after a couple weeks. I wish I’d known about @plymouthcards sooner because when we renewed our vows I would’ve done our invites & thank you cards! They’re a family owned business in Florida & I really love supporting that! They were kind enough to send me a discount code so if you need some great quality, unique cards use JAMIE20 to get 20% off your entire first order.🙌🏼 Btw, the other thing I love is that there is no minimum. Link in my bio & I put a close up photo of the card in my insta story.👶🏼🎀 #birthannouncement #cards #ad

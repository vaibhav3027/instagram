Outfit of the day ... 💁🏼 I share all the details in my insta story! 🤣 Lol no but seriously, I love every bit of my postpartum bod. It's truly amazing how my body helped create & carry an 8 lb 4 oz baby .... I'm feelin' like I can conquer the WORLD after pushing her out.🙌🏼 Women are SO much stronger than we give ourselves credit for.💕 #OOTD #newmomma #hotmama #postpartumbody #feelinghot #loveyourself

Me and my girl got all bundled up and went for a nice little walk on this beautiful fall day. 🍂 I remember I used to take my nephew for walks. As I pushed him in the stroller I’d wonder when it’d be *my* baby in the carriage? Not gonna lie, I wasn’t always optimistic & each month I got a negative result on the pregnancy test I’d become more & more impatient for my baby.🙏🏼 Today as we were walking I looked down & thought about ALL the times I dreamed of having that exact ‘mommy’ moment - pushing *my* baby in the stroller.☺️ ....Couldn’t help but smile for my Whole. Entire. Walk.👶🏼💗 #feelingblessed #thankful #mysavinggrace #graciegirl

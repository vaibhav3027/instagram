To surprise my hubby you have to be way ahead of the game. If I waited until Valentines Day to surprise him with his gift - forget it. He'd be expecting it. (We give each other way too many surprises so it gets harder and harder!)🤗 lol ...I blogged about finding the perfect gift for my amazing hubs and pulling off another great surprise! 🎉 I got him an @ediblearrangements bouquet and he was so THRILLED. 🤗❤ ...I showed up at his work to surprise him and make his day, but what I found front and center on his desk warmed my heart and made MY day - It was the photo frame from when I told him we are PREGNANT! This is the best #valentinesday ever. 💕👶🏼🎉 If you're still looking for a great gift for your love check out my blog (link in bio). #ediblearrangements is really affordable, it's delicious, and it's such a sweet surprise! Not to mention, their bouquets are really so beautiful & yummy!🍇🍓🍍 #ediblevalentinesday #giftsforher #giftsforhim #valentines #spon #ad PS #bachelor fans ... this is a perfect centerpiece or dessert for a bachelor viewing party 💃🏻🌹

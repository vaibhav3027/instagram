#flashbackfriday ... We were celebrating a whole lot more than just the new year 🎉 ... we had just found out a couple weeks earlier that we are pregnant!!!😃 Our joy couldn't be contained.💕(I was only a little nauseous and A LOT tired! lol Oh, the struggle of the first trimester!) 🤗👶🏼💞 #pregnacy #pregnant #preggers #babylove #rainbowbaby

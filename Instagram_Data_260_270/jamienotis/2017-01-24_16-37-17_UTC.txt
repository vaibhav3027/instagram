It's not very often I feel this way (like so many women - I'm my worst critic) but I am really proud of myself. After last summer's storm I made a commitment to myself to become healthier in every way possible just in case God blesses us with a rainbow. 🙏🌈 I've been choosing healthier foods, began yoga, and going to the gym. I never knew how important "refueling after a workout" is until my hubby told me that if I didn't all of my efforts could be lost! Now I always have a @310Nutrition shake after working out to ensure my body gets the exact amount of protein, vitamins and everything it needs to perform at its best! If you're trying to become healthier I'd definitely recommend paying yourself a compliment for every small victory you achieve (going to the gym when you'd rather be on the couch with the remote and popcorn🙋🏼 deserves a huge pat on the back for realsss 😜) I also recommend trying 310 protein shakes for two reasons: A) it's tasty & delicious B) their starter kit is on SALE for 80% off! Good luck getting in shape. You can do this! 💪🏾👊link in bio or here: www.310starterkit.com #310shake #ad

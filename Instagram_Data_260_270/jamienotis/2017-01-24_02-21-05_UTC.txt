2 years ago TODAY my hubby and I chose each other & renewed our vows after having been matched scientifically by experts & married as strangers ... And I'd choose him over and over and over again. I love you @doughehner. 💞👰🏻PS ... bride-to-be's I've got a fitness blog up for you ladies. (Link in bio.) #thankful #blessed #marriedatfirstsight #mafs #marriedlife #happyanniversary

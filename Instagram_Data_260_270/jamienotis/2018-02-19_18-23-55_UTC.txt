F I V E months💘 Ok, so she’s actually 6 months in a few days🙈 Maybe one day I’ll get to posting these earlier.🤷🏻‍♀️ She has grown tremendously during her fifth month.💫 She went from being wobbly while sitting up to fully sitting up on her own.🤗 She can grab her pacifier and put it in her own mouth. And she holds her own bottle. This baby is a mover & a shaker already!👶🏼🎀 She’s the absolute best part of me.🤱🏻 She brings SO much love & happiness into our lives. Her daddy and I couldn’t be more proud and more in love.💞 (But then next month I’ll look at this pic and be like”I thought I loved her then ... but I loooove her even more now!)💖Does this happen to anyone else?! Just when I think my heart is so full it could explode with love & happiness it somehow finds more room to grow for her!😍💗☺️ #oureverything #bestpartofme #mylove #5monthsold #happygirl #isit ....aaaand I just realized her bow is upside down.🤦🏻‍♀️ What can I say - #MomLife !

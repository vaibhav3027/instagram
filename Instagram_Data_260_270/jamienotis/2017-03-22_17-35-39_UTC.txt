It's so crazy to think that THREE years ago today I was finishing the last minute preparations for my wedding that would take place the very next day - marrying a complete stranger!🙀 I think about it now and I kinda can't believe I ever put that much faith and trust in experts and a scientific experiment. ...What on earth was I thinking???🙈 I'm really not one who believes in love at first sight or fairytales so it's still so shocking to me that I ever followed through - I am SO happy that I did, though.💕 The day of our wedding I definitely freaked out a bit.🙈 ....If only I could have been able to fast forward to three years later! I would have seen myself falling madly in love, finding my best friend, and having some of the best times of my life with my hubby @doughehner.💞 We found each other in the strangest way (or rather we were found for each other😜) and it's always a bit strange admitting to strangers how we met. (Always a LONG story if they haven't seen the show.) BUT, I wouldn't change any of it for the whole wide world! I've been blessed with the most loyal, loving, kind, patient, and altogether AMAZING man.😍 First we were stranger husband and wife and now we are going to become the HAPPIEST mommy and daddy.👶🏼🌈 Ohhhh I can barely contain my excitement.✨🤗 I am blessed beyond all belief and I always thank my lucky stars to have such an amazing hubby.💫 Thank you #marriedatfirstsight & everyone behind it for believing in this process and for finding me my soul mate.💕 #thankful #blessed #happyanniversary #hubby #mafs #weddingdress #wedding

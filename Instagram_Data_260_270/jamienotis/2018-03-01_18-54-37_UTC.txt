I delivered my baby in this room - in this exact bed.🤱🏻 It’s so amazing to come to work and always have the best memories from the best day of my life come flooding back.👶🏼🎀 And I get to see (and work with) the amazing nurses & midwife who helped deliver her.🤗 #feelingblessed 💕 PS my baby isn’t even with me and she still eats before me. It’s my lunch break & I pump before eating ... I feel like maternal instincts kick in full throttle after having a baby.☺️ PPS wish i had my philips avent pump (looove that pump!) but i was running late. Lol. #momlife #nurselife #laboranddelivery #nurse #rn

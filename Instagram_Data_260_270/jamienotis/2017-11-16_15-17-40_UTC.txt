Gettin’ vulnerable here.😬 When Doug & I first realised we were genuinely in love & decided to stick out this crazy married at first sight marriage, I gave up my nyc apartment & we moved to New Jersey.🏡 I had no friends here and honestly, I had a REALLY hard time making friends.🙈 I️ was a lonely, pitiful soul.🙃 My sister in law reached out to me, but that was really it. I had no idea how to make friends in this new area.🤷🏻‍♀️ I felt the same way about motherhood until I found this app called @peanut. We have been very open with the public about our story and having Henley, and this app has allowed me to connect and become friends with other moms nearby who have been through similar struggles. The app shows you women in your neighbourhood with similar-aged children, and matches you with other moms based on shared interests. You can chat, create group chats, and easily arrange meet ups. As we all navigate motherhood together, it’s really amazing to meet other mamas out there and it’s really helped me. Moms, if you know this struggle - you need to check out @peanut for yourself!🤗 #peanut #womensupportingwomen #momlife #ad |📷: @amandadollyphotography

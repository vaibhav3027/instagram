Ohhh 19 weeks and we already CHERISH this sweet baby.😍 I can't believe that he/she can actually hear our voices now!🤗 Doug's been singing to this little one ... it's so sweet. 💕 19 weeks means we are ALMOST half way there! That makes me SO excited and SO nervous! We have so much to do in order to prep for this little one. This is by far the best journey we've been on together. And it just keeps getting better and better! 👶🏼🌈 #rainbowbaby #pregnancyjourney #preggo #preggers #babybump

"Do I look like Chip from Baskets?!?!" ... my hubby was all too excited to put a man bun on his head and make his face white trying to look like his favorite character. lol he's craaaazzaaayyyy! (I didn't have the heart to tell him his beard is waaayyy too short and hair wayyyy too thin to match) ðŸ˜œ One of his fav shows - Baskets - is coming back on this Thurs at 10 on Fx. They sent us a holiday basket (filled with stuff as silly as the show). Thanks @basketsfx ! ...If you've never seen this show you have to tune in this Thursday, Jan 19th at 10 on Fx. I blogged a review on the show (and share more funny photos of my hubby). Link in my bio. #baskets #goodtv #makemelaugh #spon @doughehner

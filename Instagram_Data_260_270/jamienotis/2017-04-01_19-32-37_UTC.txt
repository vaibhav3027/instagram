True Story: I've been super nervous lately.🙈 Doug and I have put an offer in on our absolute DREAM home.🏡 We've been through this before (and it ended with bad news twice), but so far everything is going good!🤞🏼🙌🏼 We are almost half way done with our pregnancy, too!🤰🏼...this pregnancy is so amazing because it's going so well, but I'm still so scared. It's wild to think we are actually going to have a little human relying on us for EVERYTHING! I tend to be super type A and want everything planned and in order. We are only about 4 months away from having our baby!! (So exciting and equally as scary!! ...anyone go through this???) I feel so unprepared in so many ways - starting with not being in our own home yet. Yikes! 🙈...Today my hubby and I went to the lake and just loved on each other and laughed. Sometimes we need to stop worrying and just be thankful.😍 We are so blessed to have found our dream home and to have this sweet baby growing inside me.🤗 Everything will work out - it always does! Thank you @doughehner for helping me calm down, learn to live in the moment, and just LAUGH! Life is GOOD and it all works out! 🤗👶🏼🌈💕 #rainbowbaby #pregnancyjourney #marriedlife #mafs #preggers #preggo

*update: if you don't have Fyi or you missed it I tried filming the majority of it on my insta story for ya!🤗* Sooo if you saw our first #marriedlife video tonight on @fyi you know we are already indecisive about what names we like for our baby.🙈 lol Doug likes Doug jr. and I really like Henley....and there are about 10 other names on our lists that we share at 11 tonight! ...We are open to suggestions (and hope you guys can help us find a good baby name for our sweet #babyhehner)!! 👶🏼💕 I can't wait to find out the gender so then we can narrow it down some more! 2 weeks til we know! Any good baby names that you know of?? We are so open to ideas. I feel like we need them! Lol Thanks!!! 🤗💜💙 #babynames #babynamesuggestions #pregnant #pregnancy #pregnancylife #boyorgirl #mommytobe #daddytobe

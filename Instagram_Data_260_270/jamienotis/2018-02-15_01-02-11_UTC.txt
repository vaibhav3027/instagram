I’m celebrating #GalentinesDay with my friend Jill in our @jaanuubydrneela scrubs & I brought Gracie in to meet my coworkers!👯‍♀️🏩 Jill was one of the first nurses to help me around at work when I was new. She STILL helps me out a lot!🙏🏻 We were pregnant at the same time & had our babies 6 hours apart! These scrubs are super cute, fashionable & comfy. I love the Blushing Pink color & zipper detail - so flattering. I wanted to say "thanks" to my #galentine bc when you work at a new hospital it's super overwhelming, but she's been there to help me every step of the way. Thanks girl! 😘 Happy Galentines day!💖 ...I asked Jaanuu for a discount for my Fraaans - JAMIEVDAY25 gets ya 25% off if you want some comfy, fashionable scrubs! I threw the link in my bio for ya.💗 #nurselife #rn #laboranddeliverynurse

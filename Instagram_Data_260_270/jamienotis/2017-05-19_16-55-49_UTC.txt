We had the whole dance floor to ourselves so we slow danced musicless ... and then my hubby tried to make one of those hearts with his hands over my itty bitty baby bump🤰🏼 ... A for effort. 😜😂💗 #flashbackfriday to my beautiful sis in laws wedding day! We had so much Fun!👰🏼💕 My #bump is a lot bigger now so maybe we should try this again!👶🏼🌈

About last night .. hubby and I had an amazing time in NYC celebrating our 35th month being married ... next month is our 3 year anniversary!!! 💕 We met some great frans & some new frans tooo ... sometimes explaining our story to new people makes me stop and think about how untraditional, yet amazing it is ... I still can't believe we actually got #marriedatfirstsight .. such a crazy beginning we had but I wouldn't change it for the world. It just goes to show you can find love in the strangest places if you just open your heart to it.💕 I love you, Douglas. 😘😍 And @carlyrobyngreen - you put on one heck of a show. 💜 #love #marriedlife #datenight #hubbylove #newyork

Best Birthday Surprise Yet!🙌🏼🎉 My hubby kissed me goodbye this morning & left for work .... normal schedule. Normal routine. Nothing unusual. ...So you can imagine how SHOCKED I was to see him pop out from behind the set of #TheDailyGlow to wish me a happy bday!! ☺️💃🏻🎉 Thank you, hubby for making me feel special on my bday!💕 I love you!💗PS We were in the middle of shooting The Daily Glow (it's a brand new talk show on @littlethingsusa fb page) Sooo it was all caught on camera!🎥 If you wanna watch I put the link in my bio.😍 I could watch it over and over again.☺️😍 #sosweet #bday #birthdayweekend #besthubby

This flu is no fun🙅🏻‍♀️but I’m one lucky momma because my hubby woke up with our baby so I could sleep last night.💗 I pumped and left him enough milk for two bottles.🍼 Thankfully we FINALLY found a bottle Gracie will actually take so I got a solid SIX HOURS STRAIGHT!🙌🏼 Who knew babies would be so picky about bottles??🤷🏻‍♀️ I think we’ve tried every make & model under the sun. About a month ago I went into nyc to meet with a pediatrician bc Gracie literally wouldn’t eat from a bottle. It was super tough while I was at work bc I couldn’t be there to nurse her.😞 I learned all about the #PhilipsAvent natural bottle and it’s the only one we use now.🍼 I gotta tell ya, it’s a game changer.👌🏼I don’t know if it’s because the nipple is soft & feels like real skin (seriously!) or if it’s the way the nipple paces the milk flow but she does great with it.👶🏼💕 I partnered with Philips Avent & blogged all about this new nipple & bottle bc I kept getting SO many questions. I hope this helps you out if you’re struggling with the same thing.💕 Link for blog is in my bio for ya.👍🏼 #mouthsofbabes #eatbabyeat #fedisbest #ad

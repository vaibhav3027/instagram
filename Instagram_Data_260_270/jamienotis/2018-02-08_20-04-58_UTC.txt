If you see my stories you know I am currently in yoga clothes, with a hat, and no make up shleppin’ it to the airport with my daughter in tow.✈️ (Good God, it is so hard traveling with an infant solo.)😨 ...sooo, I’m gonna post this cute mommy and me pic so I can just look at it and smile.☺️ This is just the beginning of the matching outfits.😍 LA, I can’t wait for your sun rays.☀️ | 📸: @amandadollyphotography

I've been kinda away from social media this last week. I don't know what's gotten into me?😩 Maybe because we are nearing the time we lost our sweet angel (we were 17 weeks when we lost him😟 and I just turned 16 weeks today with this baby) I've been a worried wreck. First I began cramping (very mild). Then I had a doctors appointment and even though my doctor told me everything looked fine I still thought it looked like the amniotic fluid was low ... I'll share pics of that ultrasound in my story so you don't think I was just crazy🙈 ... it really did look to me that the amniotic fluid was low.🙊 I guess maybe fear got the best of me (we lost Johnathan because he had no amniotic fluid).🙁 Anyway, I am SO happy to say that we just had a super thorough visit with another doctor and our baby is absolutely fine!🎉🙏🏼 We got to see him/her bouncing around, kicking those little legs, and sucking his/her thumb!🤗 I cannot tell you what a relief it was just to see our baby moving and content inside.☺️ The doctors say he/she is measuring perfectly, too. Feeling blessed and relieved and SUPER HAPPY doesn't even begin to describe it.💞 ...I don't know why I  was so worried - I should have known his/her big brother is looking out & making sure his little sibling is ok every step of the way. 👼🏼🌈👶🏼🙏🏼💞 #rainbowbaby #angelbaby #bigbrother #growbabygrow #prayingforhealthybaby #pregnancy #pregnant #marriedlife #blessed #happy

So #thankful My baby’s feeling much better today!🙏🏻☺️ ...I soaked up every second I could with her this morning.💕 I have to go to LA to film Married At First Sight:Unfiltered & usually I’d bring her with me, but since she’s been sick I don’t want to risk it.🙅🏻‍♀️ Sooo, grandpa came over & snapped this pic of us before I had to leave for the airport.✈️ It gets harder & harder to leave her.😥 (Mom friends, I thought it was suppose to get easier??? Lol) ...on a positive note, I LOVE being a tv host & this season of #unfiltered is one of the best soooo at least I love job! 🙌🏼💃🏻💗 ...and before a million people ask if I’m still working as a nurse - the answer is yes! I love that job too.💖 As a matter of fact, I work at the hospital on Monday!💉 PS ... does anyone else dress like they’re going to the gym when they’re flying?🕺🏼

You may have seen that I started wearing this @avawomen bracelet during my pregnancy with our rainbow baby. 👶🏼🌈💗 I loved the insights the #avabracelet gave me on my physiological stress, sleep, pulse rate, and health info throughout pregnancy. Now that Henley is here, I am using Ava to track my cycle and will be using Ava to make getting pregnant with babies 2, 3, 4, and 5 (😱 yes, that is how many babies I want 🤗) next time easier and faster! If you’re trying to conceive, this little bracelet tracks nine physiological parameters to sense your changing hormones throughout the month and detect your 5 most fertile days in real time. I peed on sticks ... and it took me forever ... I wish I had this when we were #ttc! And as a labor and delivery RN, I love that the technology has been clinically validated so it’s trustworthy. 👍🏼
I have been recommending Ava to all my girlfriends, so I wanted to share with you all as well! Code: OTIS for $20 off - link in bio💗 #ava #tryingtoconceive #pregnancylife #ad

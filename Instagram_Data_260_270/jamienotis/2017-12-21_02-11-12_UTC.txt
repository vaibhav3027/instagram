We’ve been MIA on social media today - Spent the whole day thinking of this little guy.💙 I imagine him up in heaven bouncing on clouds curled up in his Grandma Dot’s arms.👼🏼 Today he would have been one year old if he had ever made it to his due date...tomorrow we are buying a little one year old boy named Dylan Christmas presents in honor of our little boy Johnathan Edward. ...looking at Henley makes me wonder what he would have been like. Can’t wait to meet in heaven again one day.🙏🏻 #neverforget #babyboy #pregnancyloss #awareness

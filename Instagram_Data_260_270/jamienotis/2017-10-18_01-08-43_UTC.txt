✨GOOD NEWS: I’ve lost FIVE pounds!!💃🏻I've been trying to be the BEST I can be for my baby.💜 I want to be healthy and strong not only so I can provide the best care for her, but also because I want to be a great role model for her.👶🏼🎀 On October 2cd I began Arbonne’s 30 days to healthy living & I’m SO thankful for those of you who joined me on my journey bc I don't know about you, but I tend to do A LOT better if I have friends doing the same work outs/healthy eating - just to hold me accountable. I only ended up working out twice so far - yesterday & today - but in 2 1/2 weeks I’ve already lost 5 pounds! (Walking counts as a work out, right?!) I’m definitely going to do this 30 days to healthy living challenge again & if anyone wants to join me on this mission to be healthy in every way - email me - jamie@jamieotis.com. It begins November 6th.👍🏼 We can cheer each other on & hold each other accountable.🤗 I did this for my Fran Roxanne while I was pregnant and she's lost 20 pounds and feels so much better...She's my inspiration & now helps hold me accountable!☺️ I made a private fb page where we can keep in touch & help each other out. Email me jamie@jamieotis.com & I'll email you back asap with all the info.💗 PS you don't have to be a mom to join ... anyone who wants to be stronger & healthier & needs help being held accountable .... we can help each other.💕 #healthymom #strongwomen #womensupportingwomen

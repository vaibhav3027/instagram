When my daughter looks at me I want her to see a strong, confident, loving, and caring mommy.🤱🏻 I want to be the best role model for her.💗 I have seriously been in a rut the last few weeks, but I’m kickin’ my own butt ✋🏻 - not just for me, but for her. The other day I sat around in my sweats & greasy hair scrollin’ through Instagram. I’ve been obsessed with mom pages & when I see all these other mama’s so fit and happy it makes me feel like “why can’t I be a ‘fit mama’ too?!”🤷🏻‍♀️ I came across @nancyandersonfit and instantly began stalking.👀 Like looking at 20 pics back kinda stalking.😬 I saw that she’s an expert in pre/post natal fitness - which is exactly what I need. I saw a lot of “before & after” pics that were pretty incredible. Soooo, I reached out to her and asked her what it was all about. She has a 30 day slim down program that’s a nursing-friendly meal plan AND has a Facebook community for support & coaching throughout the 30 days!👍🏼 It starts 2/5 and I’m gonna do it.🙌🏼 For me. For Gracie. For my hubby.☺️ I’m doing it for the mental health & physical health.💪🏼 I’m inviting everyone (not just mamas) to join me if you’ve been needing to kick your own butt, too.😛💗Link in bio for more info if you want it!👌🏼When I reached out to her she said she’d be happy to give a $10 discount to me & my followers with code Jamie10!🤗| 📸: @amandadollyphotography #fitmom #oneday #soon 🙏🏻☺️ ..... and this makes day ✌🏼 I’ve written a novel for ya to read in my caption.🤦🏻‍♀️ lol.

Life hack tip: When you don’t feel good about yourself curl your hair, do your makeup, & throw on some sunnies.😎 I love partnering with @diffeyewear bc for every pair sold they donate a pair of reading glasses to someone in need!👍🏼 Another life hack tip: When you are feelin’ gloomy, volunteer or find a way to give back. It makes me feel good about myself when I donate or buy things from companies that help the less fortunate.💕 Use my code OTIS25 for 25% off.  #DIFFpartner #diffeyewear

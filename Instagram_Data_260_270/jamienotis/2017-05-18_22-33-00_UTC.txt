Woah, Baby! Our baby girl is the size of a CANTALOUPE!👶🏼🌈 ...I'm not the only wife from Married At First Sight talking babies. I blogged all about a new bride dropping the "I want babies YESTERDAY" bomb on her newbie hubby. (Link in bio.) ...Just think, in a year (more or less) she could have this cantaloupe in her belly too ... 🤞🏼🤰🏼💕 I'm #TeamBaby! 🤗😍

Our very first kiss of 2017 was so magical. To be with the man of my dreams, standing in the heart of #timessquare, watching the ball drop together and then kissing with fireworks going off behind us  and confetti falling all around us was absolutely spectacular. The energy was electric and love filled the air. 2017 is going to be an amazing year, I can just feel it. I love you @doughehner. Cheers to an amazing new year & growing our little family. üôè‚ù§Ô∏è #HappyNewYear #TimeSquareNYC #NYE #MarriedAtFirstSight #mafs #love @fyi

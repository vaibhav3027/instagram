#flashbackfriday to when my beautiful sis in law was only dating a guy named Joe. ...This was before he stole her heart and completely swept her off her feet.😍 ...Fast forward to today! The day before their WEDDING!!!👰🏼🎉💗 She may be taking his last name, but she'll always be a Hehner.💜💃🏻 @renhehlynds33 - cannot wait to celebrate your big day with you tomorrow!✨ I'm so blessed to have such an amazing sis in law ..... you're one of the most generous, funniest, kindest souls ... and one of the biggest worry-worts I've ever met! 😜😘 I hope you both have the best day of your lives! I love you! 💞 #HtotheZizza 💍👰🏼💕

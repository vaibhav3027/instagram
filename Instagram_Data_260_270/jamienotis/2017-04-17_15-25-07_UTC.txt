I'm LOVING this spring weather!💐 I really want to be the best mommy I can be & I feel like it begins with pregnancy.🤰🏼Since becoming pregnant I've really began paying attention to what I'm putting into my body - and I know that what we put ON our body also goes INTO our body. (Did you know our skin is the largest organ in the body?) I learned this is nursing school ... but I had no idea how many cancer/disease- causing ingredients are in our everyday makeup and skincare products - it's absolutely shocking!😩 I've always said "cheaper is better bc I'm getting a deal." I've learned that that isn't always the case. Sometimes cheaper is better because it's exactly what it says - cheaply made with poor, unsafe ingredients.😦 Because of this I've switched to #Arbonne. And luckily Arbonne isn't crazy expensive, but it's SIGNIFICANTLY healthier.🌱 I researched Arbonne extensively before I made this switch ... their philosophy is pure, safe and beneficial.🍃 I fell so in love with their makeup, skin care, and baby line that I've become an independent consultant with them. Here I'm wearing their lipgloss, light cc cream, mascara, and bronzer.  I've linked the lipgloss in my bio - check out my site and if you have any questions please feel free to email me - jamie@jamieotis.com. I'm dedicated to helping more mommies keep their families safe by making the switch to healthier ingredients for their kiddos and themselves.💜🤰🏼👶🏼🍃 site: JamieOtis.Arbonne.com Email me if you have any questions, I'd love to help you find safer products,too - jamie@jamieotis.com. 💚

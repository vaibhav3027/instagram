This baby girl & I are on our very first adventure just the two of us.💗It’s going to be her first time flying & first trip to LA!✈️ Excited and scared all at the same time! Wish this momma some luck, puuhhlease!🙏🏻 lol PS in this photo she’s only 2 weeks old and our greatest adventure was just keeping the 💩 in the diaper. We’ve grown!🤗 haha!| 📸:@amandadollyphotography

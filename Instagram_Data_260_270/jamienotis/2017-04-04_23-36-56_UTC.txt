So this is kinda scary for me to share, but I'm all about being REAL and hopefully helping others by doing so!✨...this is my "before" and "after" completely unedited.😱 My before is my face without a drop of makeup - see, I wasn't lying when I told y'all my skin is breaking out in the worst way. 🙈😳 I was chatting with my friend @elroy02 & she shared her experience with #arbonne with me. After reading loads of info on these products I decided to try 'em.💄I instantly fell in love for more reasons than I can comment under one photo.😻 In this post I'm focusing on their CC creme.🌟 It is a primer, foundation, moisturizer, concealer, pore minimizer, and more.💫 It does not contain spf so it's great for photos. It is a light weight, high definition makeup that is buildable. It's what I am using to help cover these bright red blemishes on my chin & even out my skin tone.⭐️ It seriously works SO well - as you can see.🤗 It's vegan, 100% cruelty free, and gluten free...and SAFE for my growing baby.👶🏼🌈 Im literally in love and figured I'd share it with y'all (link in bio) just in case someone else is looking for a great cc creme/foundation to cover pimples and even out skin tones.😍 (I also used a concealer - if you want that info too just email me at jamie@jamieotis.com and I'll share with ya!) Also, I did a Facebook Live yesterday showing you how i use the products and WHY I made the switch to Arbonne...you can see that video on my FB page.💞 so yeah, if you read this far then check out the link in my bio for the CC Creme ... I really think you'll love it!💕 Feel free to browse and if you have any questions at all comment below. I read all of your guys' comments.👯 Cheers to covering up those ugly facial impurities in a safe, pure, & beneficial way!💃🏻site: jamieotis.Arbonne.com - email me if you have Any questions. I'd love to help ya! Jamie@jamieotis.com 💚

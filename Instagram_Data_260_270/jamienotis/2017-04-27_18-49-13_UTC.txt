We are 23 weeks pregnant today!👶🏼🎀 Our little princess can feel movements now so we dance together a lot.💃🏻💕 She can also hear EVERYTHING ... even her big sisters barking.🐶 (We believe our fur babies are part of the fam!)🐾💜I just love the thought of knowing she will recognize our voices immediately!☺️ And if you missed it - WE'RE HAVING A BABY GIRL!💕👶🏼🎀 Get ready for matching mommy & me everything!!! I cannot wait to be twinning with my daughter!👯 ...Thursdays are also a NEW ep of Married At First Sight days!🎉 Tonight at 8:45 on @lifetimetv UNFILTERED is back!🙌🏼 I sit down with the couples from MAFS & we chat all about their weddings.🙀 I blogged my recap (some moments are absolutely cringe-worthy). Link in bio.👰🏼💍

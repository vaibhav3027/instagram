One of the last pics of my bump.🤰🏼 We were so proud to *FINALLY* have the car packed with all the essentials just in case @henleygracehehner wanted to come.☺️ Car seat installed✔️ Hospital bag packed & ready ✔️ And last but certainly not least - our safety net - the @americord cord blood banking kit✔️✔️ ....it's almost like she knew we were finally ready bc our sweet girl came to meet us this morning at 5:22 am weighing 8 lb 2 oz and 20 inches long. 👶🏼💗 Maybe we should have had our essentials together earlier & she would have been in our arms sooner. 😜💓 #bestdayofmylife #MyGracieGirl #lifehasjustbegun #myfamily PS as a nurse, I definitely, definitely, definitely recommend looking into cord blood banking. When it comes to our babies, it's better to be safe than sorry. Link for more info in my bio. 💕 #cordbloodbanking #worthit #ad

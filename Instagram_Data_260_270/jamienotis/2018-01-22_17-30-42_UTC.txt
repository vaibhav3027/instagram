Gracie is 5 months old today!👶🏼💖 (I don’t know whether to cry or celebrate🌟 - she’s almost half a year old! Where does the time go?!)😭 Although I’m a registered nurse and work in labor and delivery, being a first time mom came with a slew of challenges for me!😬 My goal is to exclusively nurse for one year. But going back to work I had to introduce the bottle and my goodness, I had such an issue getting her to take from a bottle.🍼 Who knew babies would be so picky about bottles?!🤷🏻‍♀️ I went into NYC last month to chat with a pediatrician and she recommended #philipsavent “natural” ... I shared some of her advice on my Instagram stories & realized I’m not alone in the sleep, teething, bottle/nursing, etc issues I’m having. I got SO many questions about “what did the doc recommend?!” Sooo, I asked if she would go live on my Instagram page to answer my Frans questions too. And she said she would!🤗 So today at 4EST, Dr. Tanya Altmann and I are joining to answer all of your baby questions ....I have a list of questions from you guys from my last post but if you have one in particular that’s not on the list jot it down below & I’ll ask her for ya when we are live!💗 #fedisbest #mouthsofbabes #breastfeeding #nursing #bottlefeeding #ad

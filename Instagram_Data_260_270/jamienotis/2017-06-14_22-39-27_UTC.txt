It's the last day of being 30 for me.🤗 I always thought the thirties would be my decade. I finally had a career, a hubby, we had an offer in on a perfect home and I was 3 months pregnant when I turned the big 3-0. ...but within a month my whole life changed in the worst way, to say the least.😞 We found out a week before closing we couldn't get our home & worst of all, we lost our sweet boy, Johnathan.👼🏼💙 I definitely went into a depression - though I wouldn't have admitted it then. ...what I thought was going to be my "BEST year ever" turned out to begin in the most devastating way. 😕 There were times I literally sat on the couch in the dark and just cried uncontrollably. I felt so empty without my sweet boy rolling around inside me. .... but the saying "After every storm there's a rainbow" is true. On the day Johnathan was due to be born we found out I was pregnant! He sent us his little sister.👶🏼🌈 Johnathan has clearly been watching over her because this baby girl is full of energy inside me & at every doctor appointment they reassure me she's growing strong and healthy.🙏🏼💗 ...If you're going through a tough time & feel like you'll never make it through (been there, done that - terrible feeling) please know that you WILL get through it.🙏🏼 I promise you.💕 ....and on that note I wanna thank all of you who took a moment out to wish doug and I well when we went through this tough time. You'll never know how much it meant (and still means) to us!💜 ok, clearly I'm hormonal right now bc this is the longest post ever, but I couldn't help but look back and be thankful that we made it though that storm, we now have a guardian angel, and a little rainbow baby on the way. Im so ready for 31!🤰🏼💃🏻🎉 #birthday #reminiscing #thankful #blessed

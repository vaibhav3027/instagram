❌Mommy truths: Lately I haven’t been able to get out of yoga pants, a sweatshirt & a hat.🙄 Buuut it’s my baby’s first #Christmas & I’d rather spend all my extra time giving her kisses & lovings than getting myself all dressed up. Maybe one day I’ll find the time do both.🙏🏻 Until then, I’ll live in sweats.🤗 I’m so excited to have @henleygracehehner this Christmas.🎄 She’s the best gift ever.🎁 #thankful #bestgiftever #merrychristmas &&& #happyholidays 💖

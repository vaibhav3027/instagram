I am so loving being pregnant with our little girl.👶🏼💗 Learning about how she is growing each week and how my body is changing with the @avawomen bracelet has made it that much sweeter 💕 I wear Ava to sleep at night 😴 to track my resting pulse rate, sleep, and stress. I have been super transparent with you all about my trying to conceive journey, and you know it wasn't always an easy one. What I love most about Ava is that it can track your cycle (when you're not pregnant) in real time to tell you your 5 most fertile days so you can get pregnant faster.🤰🏼I made sure to get you all the promo code: OTIS for $20 off - link in bio for ya!🤗 #pregnant #ad

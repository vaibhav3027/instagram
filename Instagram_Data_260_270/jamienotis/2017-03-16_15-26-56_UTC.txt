We are actually 17 weeks today.🙈 Somehow I always get behind posting these #babybump pics.🤰🏼 It was at this time with my last pregnancy that I lost my sweet baby boy. It was 17 weeks, 1 day.... tomorrow is going to be so bittersweet. I'm so sad to think of my angel in heaven never having a chance to grow and laugh and be snuggled and rocked, but I'm so happy to know that he's watching out for his little sibling and he/she is so strong, healthy, and happy.💞 I want to do something special to honor my sweet angel baby, Johnathan. I remember holding his little body and kissing his sweet face....my sweet, sweet baby boy. 😢 If any of you angel mommies have a good idea as to how to cope/remember your angel at this stage of pregnancy please share. I could use some good tips. 🙏🏼I'll never forget our Johnny and his mommy and daddy will ALWAYS love him.💞 He will always be our first born and our baby's big brother. We love you & miss you, Johnny. 👼🏼💙 #angelbaby #mommyofanangel #pregnancyloss #infantloss #pregnant #pregnancy

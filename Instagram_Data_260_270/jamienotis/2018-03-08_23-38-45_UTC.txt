Let’s be real for a minute - women are pretty freakin’ amazing.💪🏼 I mean we literally grow babies in our bodies - all the while we are also taking care of our home, partners (and kids), and a lot of us are still working full time. Then after 9 months of supplying every nutrient necessary to take small cells and turn ‘em into a 6-10 pound baby👶🏼, we push him/her out of our who-ha!🤰🏼{Or some women have major abdominal surgery!} Then we go home where we will wake up every 2-3 hours to feed, change, and nurture our baby. We can’t eat, sleep, shower, or do ANYTHING without putting our babies first. And let’s not forget about the rest of the family we continue to take care of.💗 I’ve never felt more Super Woman than I do now after having my daughter.🌟 And I fully intend on teaching her early on that she is strong, worthy, and she can do ANYTHING she puts her mind to. Bc let’s be honest, who run the world? GIRLS.💥 #happyinternationalwomensday #girlpower #bossbabe #strongwomen

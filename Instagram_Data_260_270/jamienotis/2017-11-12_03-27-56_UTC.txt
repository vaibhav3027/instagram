I’m sitting here nursing my baby & looking at old pics on my phone.🤰🏼 So surreal to look at this photo from my first day of maternity leave.☺️ Now I️ have my baby in my arms👶🏼💕 ...& my first day back to work is Monday.😭 So many mixed feelings though because I’ve never been been away from @henleygracehehner for 12 hours straight ... but I know it’s good for us.😌 I️ def can’t wait to see my coworkers!!!😻#nurse #nurselife #workingmom #maternityleave

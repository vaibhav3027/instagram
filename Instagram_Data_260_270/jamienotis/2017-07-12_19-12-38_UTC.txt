A year ago from today was our last full day pregnant with our first born son. Johnathan was delivered on July 13th, 2016 at just 17 weeks, 1 day. He was way too little to survive outside the womb.😢 I remember feeling so helpless - there was nothing I could do to help my baby.😥 I swore to myself, to my hubby, to God, to my baby boy, and to ANYONE who would listen that I'd never let him just be forgotten.🙏🏼 I blogged a lot to help cope with the loneliness; to numb the pain. I will forever be thankful & I'll never forget the countless Frans - and even strangers - who reached out to me to offer love & support.💗 ...I planned ways to honor our angel baby's short, sweet life.👶🏼💙 One of the ways I wanted to remember him was by planting a tree for him & watching it grow. Now that we finally have our own home and our own backyard we can plant that tree. We researched and found a tree that blossoms all summer long.🌲 Tonight at 7 pm EST we are going to remember & love on our angel baby & we'd love for you to join us in keeping Johnny's memory alive.💚 We'll be live on Facebook at 7pm EST. Link to fb is in my bio. 👼🏼💙 #alwaysinourhearts #johnathanedward #angelbaby #bigbrother

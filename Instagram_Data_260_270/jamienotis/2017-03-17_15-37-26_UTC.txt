We are 17 weeks, 1 day pregnant today. At this point in our last pregnancy we delivered our sweet baby, Johnny, and he went to be with the Angels. I'll never forget kissing his precious face and holding his perfectly formed itty bitty body right in the palm of my hand. He was our pride and joy during our whole pregnancy and we were SO excited to have him.💕 We'll never understand why he needed to go, but we are SO thankful his little sibling growing inside me has a big brother up in heaven who is always watching over.💞 We are blessed to have our own sweet angel and our little baby growing inside me now is blessed with an angelic big brother.👼🏼 We love you to the moon and back, Johnny.❤️💫 Thanks for being such an amazing big brother and watching out for your baby sibling. 💙👼🏼 ...until we meet again. We love you SO much sweet boy.💛 #angelbaby #rainbowbaby #pregnancyloss #infantloss #mommyofanangel #johnathanedward #babyhehner #pregnant #pregnancy PS I want to give a big thank you to all of you who gave me tips on how to best honor Johnny. And thanks to Kim on Facebook who thought of this beautiful way to remember him. @doughehner and I are blessed with such a community of love and support in you all. You'll never know how much your endless love & support means to us. We love you all. 💕 #thankful ☺️

We got to see our baby today!👶🏼🌈 I just love seeing this little nugget grow bigger and bigger with each doctor visit. I've been EXHAUSTED lately - who said you get energy in the 2cd trimester?😩 ...But to see this little baby bouncing around inside me happy and healthy as can be makes it all worth it.😍 You can see this little one's face in my insta story. It's probably the cutest face I've ever seen. ☺️💗

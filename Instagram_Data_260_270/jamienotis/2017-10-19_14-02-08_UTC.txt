Oh, how I miss my #babybump.🤰🏼 I really loved being pregnant.💕 Feeling my baby grow and move inside me was SO amazing.✨ For this #throwbackthursday I am giving away two belly casts. I had bought one & got one as a gift but I kept thinkin’ I’d have more time - and then she came👶🏼💗 Sooo I never got to use ‘em. I decided to see if any of my Frans would want them or know of anyone who wants one. Let me know (🙋🏻) in the comments below & tag your #preggers friends for their chance to win. And if you and your friend are pregnant together then let me know bc that’d be awesome if you guys could do ‘em together!💗 #tbt #pregnant #39weeks | 📸: @aliblakephotography

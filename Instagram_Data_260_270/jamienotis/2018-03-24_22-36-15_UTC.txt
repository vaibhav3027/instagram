Anniversary tradition: skiing.⛷ We’ve been every year except last year bc I was #preggers with Henley.🤰🏼 *I write this like we’re avid skiers. Buuut truth is we go once a year & I eat it every time.🤷🏻‍♀️ But the bunny slope is so rough.😂🤦🏻‍♀️ ....I see why people get addicted to skiing though - it really is so much fun!🎿

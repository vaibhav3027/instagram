People called me crazy.🤐 I was going to put my blind trust in professional experts to be scientifically matched with my future husband.😬 I wouldn't know anything about him when I walked down the aisle to say "I do."🙈 Fast forward three years later and that stranger hubby I married is my best friend and soon to be my baby daddy.🤗👶🏼🌈 People still call me crazy - and they were all right about me - I'm happy and CRAZY in lovE!😍😜☺️ Tonight is the premiere of season 5 of Married At First Sight!🎉 I am so excited to see three new "crazy" couples who may potentially fall in love, live happily ever after and begin their own family just like us.🤗 I can't wait to watch these journeys!👰🏼 I introduce you to these individuals who just as crazy as me in my blog - link in my bio. Today I'll be taking over the official Instagram page of @mafslifetime (come join me!) and TONIGHT my hubby and I will be going LIVE on Facebook to chat about the first two episodes! We'll be in our PJ's and in bed ... hope you'll join us!💑

This was me last night at 11:30 pm ... "Bride" robe and all.👰🏼😴 (Yes, I still have that robe. And yes, I still use it over 3 years later!)😜 My holy grail lately is @teamiblends. I am exhausted All.The.Time but being able to actually fall asleep is tough.🙃 If you struggle with this too I promise this tea will help you will help you sleep better, and wake up more refreshed.🤗 Thankful for it during pregnancy.🤰🏼 Use code JAMIEO to save 20% on yours! PS the nurse in me wants to remind ya to ALWAYS check with your doc before trying anything new when you're pregnant...I checked w my doc, too.💗 #thankyouteami #sp

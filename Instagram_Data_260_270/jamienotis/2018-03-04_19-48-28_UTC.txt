I’m at work walking around smilin’ and saying hi to everyone I see all happy and go-lucky bc my hubby sent me a video of our sweet girl walking in her walker thingy !!! (Our Gracie girl is reaching a new milestone daily now!)👶🏼🎀 ... I go to the bathroom first chance I get after the whole morning runnin’ around helping my patients & I see this poppyseed from my bagel hangin’ out ... 🤦🏻‍♀️ BRB, gonna go brush my teeth.😬 #really #why #ugh #whatevs 🤷🏻‍♀️ #stillhappy 😂 one thing @doughehner has taught me since getting married is how much easier it is to just laugh at yourself instead of expecting perfection from yourself. 💘

About two weeks ago I went into nyc to meet with a doc to talk bottles. My sweet girl doesn’t like taking a bottle, but when I’m at work there’s no other option - which makes it extra stressful for me when I have to leave her.😥 I learned all about the  #PhilipsAvent natural bottle and for the last two weeks I’ve been using ONLY this bottle.🍼 Let me tell ya, it’s a game changer! Especially if you’re a nursing momma bc the nipple feels like a real nipple (seriously!) so there’s less nipple confusion.👌🏼 I partnered with Philips Avent & blogged all about this new nipple & bottle bc I kept getting SO many questions. I hope this helps you out if you’re struggling with the same thing.💕 Blog link in my bio for ya. 👍🏼 PS TONIGHT’S THE PREMIERE OF OUR SHOW!💃🏻 Can’t wait to share @henleygracehehner birth story with you!💖#mouthsofbabes #eatbabyeat #fedisbest #ad

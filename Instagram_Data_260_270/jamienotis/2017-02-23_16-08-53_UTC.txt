So I'm a week late posting our 13 week #babybump pic🙈 ... but better late than never ... and it's an important one because it's the very LAST bump from first trimester!!🤗 Today we are actually 14 weeks pregnant 🤰🏼 which means we have officially made it through the whole first trimester without any issues whatsoever!!🙏🏼🤗💕 Thank you, thank you, THANK YOU for all of your love, prayers, encouragement, and support .... means so much to my hubby and me.💜 Our little #babyhehner is developing fine hair all over his/her body and able to suck his/her thumb!!! We guessed our baby's gender (link in bio) but we can't agree🙈😂 ..and later today I have a doc appointment (I'll share in my story) so we get to see this little one.👶🏼💕 Daddy's working so grandma Hehner is coming to see this sweet little babe. ...oh, and Doug and I will be in NYC at the Feinstein/54 below for a little meet and greet and my friend @carlyrobyngreen #lovesongs concert. We'd love to meet you guys! More info in my story for that, too!🤗💕 #firsttrimester #buhbye #hello #secondtrimester #babybliss #babylove #pregnant #preggers #love #happiness #joy #BABY

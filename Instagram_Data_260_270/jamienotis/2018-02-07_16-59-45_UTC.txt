This may be TMI, but I never know what what size bra to wear - especially now that I'm nursing.🤷🏻‍♀️ I feel like you need a degree to figure out cup size, strap lengths, etc. I heard about a quick fit finder quiz on @thirdlove website & that they actually have half sizes so you definitely get a bra that fits.💖 I took the quiz & found out I'm actually a full size bigger than I've been wearing.🤦🏻‍♀️ They also cater to two different sized boobs (which again, TMI, but I def have one smaller than the other.)😬 They delivered my new, comfy nursing bra & racer back bra right to my front door. Another reason I gave #mythirdlove a chance was bc they have a 100% fit guarantee so if the fit isn’t right, I could exchange it until I found one that did!👌🏼 I have a code for 15% off your first order for ya if ya want it! It's “JAMIE15” P.S. I get a little PG-13 right in my kitchen on my insta story, but there’s a swipe up link for ya!) #tmi #butgoodtoknow #ad

Happy Mother's Day weekend to all you hard working mamas out there!💃🏻🎉 I'm so excited bc I get to celebrate, too!🤰🏼👶🏼 Every year I try to find the most meaningful & unique gifts for my mom and MIL. 💗 It gets hard bc what do you get women who have it ALL already?🤔 This year I found @storyworth! Get ready for this, guys because it is such an amazing, heartfelt gift!🌟 Story Worth is a way for mom/grandma to "write" her memoir! They will ask her all the questions, all she has to do is reply with her answers & then they'll deliver a beautiful hard cover book with all of her favorite memories & stories - revealing stories you may have never heard of otherwise -  and a lasting legacy on paper for her kids, grandkids & generations to come.☺️💕 (I wish I thought of this when I wrote #wifey101 - it's A LOT easier & less expensive than the way I did it!)😜 As always, I asked if I could get a discount for you guys!☺️ I partnered with story worth so you guys can get $20 off your order ... and this is great if you're looking for a last minute gift idea! (I hate to admit it, but I'm such a procrastinator, too!)🙈😝 Go to StoryWorth.com/jamie (link in bio) for more info and $20 off! I hope you all have an AMAZING Mother's Day weekend!😘 #HappyMothersDay #Enjoy #ad

My pretty baby girl is S E V E N months today!👶🏼 She’s amazed - what is all of this white fluffy stuff on the ground.❄️ This nor'easter isn't stoppin' us from celebrating another month!💘 Gracie & I got all bundled up and went outside for a walk. I had my @teamiblends skinny tea with me bc since pregnancy I've gotten in the habit of drinking it just to keep the #mombrain to a minimum.😉 It gives me enough energy to get going, but not be jittery like when I drink coffee. I highly recommend it as a healthy alternative for you mamas! Use code: JAMIEO for 15% off yours! PS When Doug gets off work I wanna build Gracie's first snowman.⛄️ Think I can convince him?😛 #noreaster #7monthsold #timeslowdown #thankyouteami

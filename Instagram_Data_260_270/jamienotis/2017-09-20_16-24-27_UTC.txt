I love being a mommy.💜 I've been trying to be the BEST I can be for my baby. I want to be healthy and strong not only so I can provide the best care for her, but also because I want to be a great role model for her.👶🏼🎀 At 6 weeks post partum I can begin working out. I plan on beginning Arbonne's 30 days to healthy living and beginning a work out routine on October 2cd.💪🏼 I don't know about you, but I tend to do A LOT better if I have friends doing the same work outs/healthy eating - just to hold me accountable. Soooo, If anyone wants to join me on this mission to be healthy in every way - email me - jamie@jamieotis.com. We can cheer each other on & hold each other accountable.🤗 I did this for my Fran Roxanne while I was pregnant and she's lost 20 pounds and feels so much better...She's my inspiration.☺️ I made a private fb page where we can keep in touch & help each other out. Email me jamie@jamieotis.com & I'll email you back asap with all the info.💗 PS you don't have to be a mom to join ... anyone who wants to be stronger & healthier & needs help being held accountable .... we can help each other.💕 #healthymom #strongwomen #womensupportingwomen

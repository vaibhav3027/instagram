It’s so crazy to think that it’s been FOUR years (in two days) since we were Married At First Sight.👰🏼 I remember being so scared when the doors to my stranger husband opened & I first laid eyes on this man I had never met but I was suppose to commit my life to.😬 There were no butterflies. No fireworks. No sparks at all.🤭 There I was in my beautiful, white wedding gown with my bouquet in my hands. I had something old, something new, something borrowed and something blue. I had envisioned some sort of instant connection with romance in the air. But there was none of that.🙅🏻‍♀️ My bridesmaids had walked down the aisle before me and my nieces were the flower girls .... it was really the most beautiful wedding .... except I had ZERO connection with this man who in two minutes (literally!) would become my stranger hubby.🙃 Right after I said “I do” I hid in a corner & crumbled to the floor. I really believed “I just made the worst decision of my life!”🙊 Fast forward to now...two days before our four year wedding anniversary. I’m currently rocking our beautiful daughter to sleep in my arms.🤱🏻 That man standing at the alter who I had zero interest in & I thought was the worst decision of my life turned out to be the BEST one.💯 He is the most loving, funny, patient, WONDERFUL man.🕺🏼We truly grow more in love by the day.☺️ It wasn’t an immediate attraction in our relationship, but we built a foundation of respect, loyalty, and friendship...and our love blossomed naturally from there.💗 Our story just goes to show that sometimes first impressions are not the correct impressions. Maybe we should give people more than one chance. That old saying ‘Don’t judge a book by its cover.’ is actually good advice. Maybe someone you think “isn’t your type” is actually the exact “type” you need and want in your life.🤷🏻‍♀️☺️💗 Happy 4 year’s, hubby! I love you and can’t wait to celebrate this weekend!😘 PS if you read all the way to this sentence then put a heart emoji at the bottom so I can say thank you & hi to ya!👋 Bc this caption is as long as a book but I meant every word.💘 #letlovein

Just dropped my Girlfraaaand @everythingerica off at the airport✈️ It’s so hard to find a friend who truly wants to help you succeed & grow - ya know how the saying goes - they wanna see you shine, but not brighter than them.🙄 ....I’m SO lucky to have a friend who would be HAPPY to see me shine bright & who is always in my corner.💘 {and im always in hers, too !👯‍♀️} I had to repost her pic bc (A) the caption almost made me cry and (B) she says I inspire her but she has no idea what an inspiration she is to me!💕I am so glad she took that “chance” on me💫 #REPOST @everythingerica ”I want to tell you a story 💗. A story about a girl, who just quit her unfulfilling job to follow her dreams and try to make something of herself 🤷🏻‍♀️. Well, I'm sure it's no surprise... this girl was me. I didn't know what I was doing, or how I'd get there, but I new I was going to figure it out. Back in November of 2015, I reached out to @jamienotis because I was so inspired by her, her story and  entrepreneurial spirit. I asked her if I could feature a piece from her jewelry line in my holiday gift guide. I took a chance and in return she's taken one million on me. For the last 2.5 years, I've gotten to know this incredible woman in more ways then I would have dreamed of 🦄. She has become one of my closest friends, true confidant and biggest cheerleader on my journey. I couldn't be more thankful for her friendship, guidance and genuine desire to see my succeed. The moral of this story is, take a chance. Reach out to those who inspires you. That person you see on the TV screen or behind your favorite blog could be one comment/DM away from being one of your best friends. 👭” #girlfriend #bff #friendshipgoals #inspiration #womensupportingwomen

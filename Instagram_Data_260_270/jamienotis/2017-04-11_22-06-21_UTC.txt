Quality time with the hubs.🤗 We are #20weeks pregnant.🤰🏼At this point in my pregnancy I feel a little more tired than usual, a little more anxious. I brought my @teamiblends Relax along with me, because it just helps me enjoy every moment to the fullest! It has chamomile, and lavender and the smell alone helps. ❤️ ... if you need help calming & de-stressing - or if you just want a yummy tea 😋 - I def recommend this. Try it and use OTIS for 15% off yours. Link in bio. ...By the way - the nurse in me wants to remind you that I always check w my doc before any new teas/products & you should too if you're #preggers.😍💞 #thankyouteami #calming #yummy #tea #sp

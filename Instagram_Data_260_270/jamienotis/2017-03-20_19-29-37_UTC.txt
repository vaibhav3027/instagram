It's the first day of SPRING!💐 And my amazing mother in law's - Bonnie - bday! 🎉💞 Happy bday Bonnie!🎈 ...So many of you asked me what maternity clothes I bought yesterday so my hubby snapped this pic while we were out walking the pups. My first outfit is totally spring inspired. I'm ready for the beach and bbq's!☀️ I really like this sweater bc my belly can grow comfortably in it.🤰🏼 And I love these jeans !!! They're the coziest/cutest maternity jeans I found. These shoes, hat and jacket I already own.💁🏼 Best of all - the bargain shopper in me is proud to say I got these jeans for $29.99 - actually, everything in this photo is on sale!🙌🏼 (I really hate paying full price for anything unless I NEED it.)😜 lol I know you guys like knowing where you can get these items for yourself so I found a way to give you all the info easily.🤗 If you download the LiketoKnow.it app and then screenshot this photo @liketoknow.it will send you an email where you can buy everything I'm wearing.💃🏻 Let me know which ones are your fav -- and if you have any MUST HAVE maternity clothes bc I'm new to this all. 😍💕👶🏼🌈 #liketkit http://liketk.it/2qLxf #LTKSaleAlert #LTKStyleTip #LTKUnder50 #LTKBump #LTKBeauty #maternityfashion #growingbump

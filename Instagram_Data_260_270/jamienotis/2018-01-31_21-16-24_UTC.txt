🙈Vent Session: I’ve been in a bit of a funk lately.🤷🏻‍♀️ It’s just that I’ve been SO busy and SO tired and I feel like everyone wants/needs something so I never have time for even the smallest things like showering & putting on normal clothes - forget hair & makeup.🤦🏻‍♀️ (OMG, if you’ve seen my stories - you know.)😬 But in this very moment👆🏼 I just stopped. Stopped frantically trying to make myself look better. Stopped trying to make myself feel better. Stopped trying to make sure everyone around me was happy. I just stopped it all.✋🏻 I’m trying something new. Instead of stressing over all of this, I’m reminding myself to be thankful. I’ve always wanted a daughter....I have longed for a mother/daughter bond since I was young.💕 My mom always tried her absolute best, but there were times she wasn’t around. She would leave us kids in order to try to help herself heal from her own difficult past. When I was a kid I’d be alone, lonely, & try to find a “mommy” in anyone who would pay attention to me. ....as I got older I knew exactly what I wanted. I wanted to become a mommy myself. If my mom wasn’t able to be my best friend & if we couldn’t have that bond that was ok. I could have it with my own daughter. ....Gracie, I am so proud to be your momma and I promise you I will never, ever leave your side. I am so excited to watch you grow. God knew my heart needed you. You’re mommy’s little saving Grace.💗 Sooo, I may not have time to get out of my pajamas. Or do my hair. Or anything for me for that matter. But I am so THANKFUL that this little human is mine & I get to be her mommy.💖 And if you read allll of this -THANK YOU!🙏🏻- put a heart emoji in the comments so I can thank you for listening bc it genuinely means SO much to me.☺️💗 #ventsession #over #thankful

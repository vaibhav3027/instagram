Dear Daddy, my big brother Johnny told me today was the day he was due to be with you and mommy. He wasn't able to be here so he sent me instead. He doesn't want you to be sad during the holidays without him; instead be happy because he gave me to you! I can't wait to meet you in August. Love, baby Hehner. 💕...my hubby and I had been trying for months to get pregnant.  We found out we're expecting on the day my sweet Johnathan was due. This is how I told my hubs we're pregnant! @usweekly made a beautiful tribute to our sweet angel baby, Johnathan. Thank you for keeping his memory alive.👼🏼💙 Link in bio. #preggers #pregnant #angelbaby #rainbowbaby #pregnancyannouncement

"The couples that are meant to be are the ones who go through everything that is meant to tear them apart but they only grow stronger & remain happy together." ... Hubby, we were meant to be. It was destiny that we met and fell in love. ...I'm SO excited about 2017. I love you!🤗❤️😘@doughehner #love #marriedlife #hubby #mafs

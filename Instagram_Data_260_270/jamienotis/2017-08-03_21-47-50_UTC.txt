Every time I think about our little girl, I get this huge smile on my face!☺️ Then I go into mommy-mode and think of all the ways I can protect her.👶🏼💕 As a Registered Nurse & expectant mother, it is so important to understand the importance of umbilical cord blood banking. I am so happy I got my kit in time for baby’s arrival! (Phew, I feel like I may have been cutting it close since we are already 37 wks!)🙌🏼 I've talked over my options with my support team & we agreed that cord blood banking has remarkable life-saving potential...I feel like it's better to be safe (and prepared) than sorry.🤰🏼 @americord has guided us through this delicate journey that we have so patiently waited for. Cord blood banking has given me a piece-of-mind while I finish the final touches on our prep for baby's journey... We cannot wait to meet you, baby girl. We will see you very soon.👶🏼🌈 If you want to learn more about the potentially life-saving benefits of cord blood banking I put the link in my bio for you.😊💕 See you all at 7 EST over on my Facebook - cannot wait to share her name with you guys! 💜💗 #cordblood #worthit #bettersafethansorry #ad

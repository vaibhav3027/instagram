Hubs and I went maternity clothes shopping today!💞 It's so fun finding clothes to show off the #bump.🤰🏼 I snapped this pic on our way home....totally chopped half of my face off, but look how handsome my hubby is. 😍 ....One of these days we will figure out how to take a good selfie!😜 #rainbowbaby #babyhehner #growbabygrow #babybump #maternity #maternityfashion #preggo #preggers

I can’t believe it! My baby girl has been sitting up all by herself like such a big girl for a couple weeks now! At first I thought it was just a fluke, but she’s been doing it daily without falling over!💞 In a week she’ll be SIX MONTHS old.🙈 Time, slow down!🙏🏻 #soproud #mybiggirl #prettybaby PS I’m taking her “five mo old” pics today ... ALWAYS behind on those.🤦🏻‍♀️ Lol

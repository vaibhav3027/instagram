It’s so sweet to see my hubby wake up SO excited for his #ValentinesDay gifts.💖 He’d been eyeing that fancy pen and these Versace belt & shoes for weeks on TrendSavvy.com.👀 Thank God @trendsavvyofficial has the steepest discounts or I wouldn’t have been able to afford these for him.☺️ Douglas, I am SO proud of you. You’ve ALWAYS been an amazing hubby, but since having Gracie you’ve been the most INCREDIBLE daddy too!💕 You work so, so hard to make us happy every single day so I wanted to go above & beyond for YOU for Valentine’s Day.😍 Gracie & I are so lucky to have you! I hope you know how much we love & appreciate you!!! Have a nice day at work in your new shoes & fancy belt.❤️ Can’t wait for you to get home so we can celebrate.😘 I love you so much my heart could explode.💕...

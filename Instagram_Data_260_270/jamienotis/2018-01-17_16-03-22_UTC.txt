We began giving Henley solids, which is a huge milestone!🤗 Her first food: avocados.🥑 I want the best foods for her, but I feel like I don’t have time to go shopping up & down aisles so I tried out Thrive Market.✅ They have  healthy and organic options at literally wholesale prices!🙌🏼 I can filter thousands of premium foods by 90 categories including vegan, paleo, gluten-free & non-gmo!😋 And it's delivered right to my door! 📦 @thrivemkt is offering you $60 of FREE organic groceries + FREE Shipping. (Link in Bio or Go to http://thrivemarket.com/jamie - no code is necessary bc it will be applied at checkout.)👍🏼 Oh, and I noticed most of their catalog CAN'T be found on Amazon!🙅🏻‍♀️ PS - their nut butter selection is amazing too!🥜 #thrivemarket #healthyfood #ad

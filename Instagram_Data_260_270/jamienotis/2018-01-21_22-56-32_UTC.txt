The weather was soo beautiful today so we took Gracie for her very first trip to the park.👶🏼💗 It’s so surreal to go to one of my hometown childhood parks with my very own baby.☺️ We went down the slide & on the swing...and thank God she takes to bottles now bc no way was I gonna nurse her in the cold.🙅🏻‍♀️ haha. I had the most difficult time finding a bottle she would take while nursing ... I ended up going into NYC in December & had a chat with a pediatrician who recommended #philipsavent.🍼 I tried their “natural” bottle & we’ve never had a problem since! I got countless emails & comments asking me sooo many questions about the advice this doc gave me so I reached out & asked if she’d be willing to join me on a Instagram LIVE to answer my fraaans questions & she said yes!🙌🏼💗😍 Soo, tomorrow (Monday 1/22) at 4EST Dr. Altmann will be answering all of your baby questions ... if you’re a expecting mom or a new mama (or even an experienced mom too) & you have a question re: nursing, bottle feeding, sleep - ANYTHING BABY - throw ‘em in the comments below & I’ll put them together & ask her tomorrow for ya. Join us at 4 EST tomorrow LIVE on my Instagram.💗 Can’t wait to see ya then!💖 #fedisbest #mouthsofbabes #breastfeeding #nursing #bottlefeeding #ad

I love my coffee and tea!! ☕️ Since becoming pregnant I've had more tea than coffee ... and I kinda thought maybe the stains wouldn't be as bad because I haven't had red wine in months ... but I guess all it takes is the coffee and tea bc my teeth got that ugly yellow stain.😩 I know a lot of teeth whiteners aren't safe with pregnancy so I found one that is peroxide free and safe! I double checked with my doc just to be sure! 👌🏼 I used @whitewithstyle to get my pearly whites back. I asked them if my frans could get a discount code in case they want to try it too - use code Jamie28 to get your pearly whites for $28.99 (it's originally $269.99) I blogged about this for y'all if you want more info & wanna order one for yourself.🤗 Link in bio. #pearlywhites #smile #bright 😄#spon #sp #ad whitewithstyle.com

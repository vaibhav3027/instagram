I am sooooo excited to show you guys my new BB Dakota Poncho!🍂 #fabfitfunpartner I got all dolled up last night with this ultra cozy knit accessory for #datenight &&& then one look at my baby & we stayed home.👶🏼💗 I seriously love this poncho though bc it’s super cute but also reversible, warm, & comfy.💕 The best part? It can be styled differently - whether you want to layer it, pair with a belt, or wear on its own. Thanks to @fabfitfun you guys can get $10 off at http://www.fabfitfun.com and use the coupon code BBDAKOTA #fabfitfun. I tag @brittany to show you how she’s styling her BB Dakota Poncho!

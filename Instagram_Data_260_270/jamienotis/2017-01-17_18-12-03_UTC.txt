Hubby, 2 years ago today you made my mascara run down my face - for all the right reasons!🤗❤️💍 The best surprise proposal ever - and of course I said YES! (Still makes me giggle to think I was getting engaged while being married already!) We did this whole thing backwards and lopsided, but I'd have it no other way! I love you @doughehner & I can't wait to have your babies!👶❤️ PS ... to my married friends - would you ever agree to swapping partners to help improve your relationship? That's what 4 couples are doing on #SevenYearSwitch. We've been watching and we already fear a swapped couple may be unfaithful. I blogged about this all. Link in bio. PSS let me know if you're watching Bc I love having someone to chat with (my hubby doesn't always watch with me but thankfully my friend @elroy02 does!) 😜❤️ #mafs #marriedatfirstsight #love #relationship #marriedlife

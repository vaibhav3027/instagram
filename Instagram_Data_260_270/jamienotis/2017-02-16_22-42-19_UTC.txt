We are at the end of our first trimester!!!🤗💕 I feel like that is a huge accomplishment!🙌🏼 We are 1/3 of the way there! ...And I have a confession to make - I havent bought one thing for our baby yet. 😬 Between fear and the unknown I have just focused on making it through. I'm happy to share that that's changed & the very first thing I've gotten in preparation for our little #babyhehner is this @21bundles box! It's filled with natural and organic products safe for me and baby! I looove this - they send you a box filled with necessities for each month of your pregnancy! You can use code JAMIE20 for 20% off your first bundle!  I shared more about our first trimester and this bundle in my blog. Link in bio! 💜💙 #21bundles #firsttrimester #baby #babyontheway #babyprep #sp #ad #spon

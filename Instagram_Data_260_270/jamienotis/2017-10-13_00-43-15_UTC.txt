True Story: I got a bad hair cut.💇🏻 A real bad hair cut.🙈 I ordered a groupon bc I’m frugal. My friend owns a salon and even offered to do my hair but I figured it’d be faster to go to the salon around the corner. I walk in and this sweet, bubbly 19 year old girl says she’s my stylist. I sit in her chair and we chat about our fav tv shows, music, etc. I’m not too picky about my hair - just wanted a trim & layers. She’s cutting & I’m looking at a magazine ... next thing I know she is asking the stylist behind her to come over.🤔 I quickly realized a chunk of my hair was cut out.😳 In that moment I had two emotions rush into my head - First: Good God! My hair!!! What did this girl do?!😤 Second: She obviously didn’t mean it - at least she stopped and got help before she chopped more off.🙏🏼 As the senior stylist tried her best to blend it I could see the sweet, young stylist red in the face and sincerely upset about her mistake. She quietly slid away & hid in the back of the salon (where she didn’t come out). I instantly felt bad for her. We’ve all been young & just beginning our career. We’ve all made mistakes. She was so embarrassed she didn’t even come out to collect her tip (yep, I still tipped her - she told me she doesn’t have health insurance). I wanted to post this story in hopes that she sees it. Gina, Please know that I’m not the least bit upset about this hair. It’ll grow back ... we’ve alllll made mistakes. Don’t let this one bad hair cut stop you from believing in yourself as a hairstylist.💕 #nobigdeal #justhair #staypositive

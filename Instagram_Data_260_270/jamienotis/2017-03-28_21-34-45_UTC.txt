I wasn't planning on blogging today. I just got home and I have a TON of work to get done.🤦🏻‍♀️ But, I am SO over being bullied. I'm so sick of women shaming women.🙅🏼 I blogged about a woman who went out of her way to comment about my "lopsided" boobs. I tried to privately tell her that her comment was hurtful, but she continued with more hurtful words. Instead of letting her words make me cry I decided to stand up for women everywhere! (I am so emotional - hate to admit it!) ...my hopes in sharing this on my blog is that we will learn that it's far better to build one another up than to tear each other down.💞 We need to LOVE and SUPPORT each other. Also, I'm so SICK of bullies! It's time we stand up to these bullies and shamers - not by being mean in return but by pointing out their cruel words and actions. Maybe then they'll be embarrassed enough to stop being so hurtful to others. And if not, at least we can join together and support each other. 💕 link to blog in my bio. #womensupportingwomen #womenempowerment #standup #nomorebullying #bullyingawareness #standupagainstbullying

After a long, busy weekend launching my #arbonne business I am so excited to come home, throw on PJ's and my robe (fav outfit ever - especially now that I'm almost 6 months preggers), take my hair down and hop in bed with my pups and hubby.☺️ Nothing is more comforting than lying in bed with my baby bouncing inside me👶🏼 & my hubby rubbing my back🙏🏼... and our dogs snoring at the end of the bed.🐶 Ahhh, life is good. 👶🏼🌈😻 Thanks hubby for supporting me on yet another business venture I'm on. 🤗 @doughehner #watchmeorjoinme JamieOtis.Arbonne.Com 🌱🌷🌟

So this is what F O U R years married looks like! 🕺🏼💃🏻 If you would have told me on my wedding day that we’d make it this far I’d never have believed you!😂 {My Frans know what I’m talkin’ about!😬} I still can’t believe we were ever crazy enough to get Married At First Sight!🙅🏻‍♀️🙈 ...Douglas, I fall more in love with you every.single.day!😍 You and Gracie are my whole entire world and I thank God & all of my lucky stars that I get to wake up to you every morning & our children will get to grow up with a loving, kind, fun daddy who makes mommy smile!💘 I didn’t get to grow up with this example so it means that much more to me & I’m just so thankful for you being you.☺️💗 Thank you for being my better half. I love you!! So excited to celebrate this weekend!!! #happyanniversary #fouryears @doughehner @henleygracehehner P.S. got a new #anniversary outfit. Shared in my story! #anniversaryweekend

Three years ago today my hubby proposed to me.💍 I was completely shocked bc we were already married from being #marriedatfirstsight.👰🏼 To think that my hubby loved me & believed in us enough to get down on one knee and propose still melts my heart.😍 ...Douglas, thank you for your unending love.💕 We have built an amazing life together & we’re blessed with the most beautiful & happy baby girl.👶🏼💗 And to think it all began in the craziest way...strangers at the altar.👰🏼 I love our love-story. I love YOU!😘 #truelove #unexpected #love #blessed

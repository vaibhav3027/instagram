I remember this day so well. It was a sunny day in early December.☀️ That's rare where we live so hubby and I went outside to enjoy the day.🤗 We had been trying (and tying and trying and trying) to get pregnant. My secret, personal goal was to be pregnant before our angel baby's due date, December 20th.👼🏼 I just didn't know how I'd even be able to "go on" knowing we didn't have him and I was still so "empty" inside.😔 ...you can see in my eyes the sadness in my heart.💔 Little did I know, at this very moment our angel baby, Johnathan, had already sent his little sister to be with us.👶🏼🌈 I was a couple weeks pregnant in this pic & on Johnny's due date we would FINALLY see a positive pregnancy test. We were going to be parents to a sweet little #rainbowbaby.🙏🏼 No matter what you're struggling with, keep the faith.💗 #flashbackfriday #keepthefaith #inspiration

***Update: I just read a comment that really hurt. She didn’t mean for it to be hurtful, but it still was. She basically said that I post nursing pics every other day and “Enough.” ...I just wanna say to all the other mamas who nurse that this whole post Is now dedicated to you. The mamas who can’t even go to the hair salon without our baby needing to eat. And then we discretely feed our babies always hoping & praying no one judges. Gosh, I hope I truly stop caring one day. But this is to help you other mamas know you aren’t alone. It happens to all of us still. Maybe one day it will stop.🙏🏻👶🏼💗*** A day in the life of being a mom ... this is #reallife & I don’t hate it.☺️💗 Soo remember when I had that bad hair cut a couple months ago?! Well, it has *kinda, sorta* grown out. I wanted to go lighter (and I took a poll on my insta story asking my story fam what they thought - you guys agreed for lighter🙌🏼) soooo I did it!!!💁🏼‍♀️ My friend Liz owns @lstudionj & she worked her magic on my color. Kara is her amazing stylist - she blended the remaining chunk so you can’t even tell there was ever a bad hair cut. .... I really cannot believe how great of a job they did!💗 I was so excited to share the reveal with my Frans so I went LIVE yesterday to show ya.😘 And if you see my story you know Gracie loooves my new hair, too.🙈😂 {I totally wanted to share this with you guys bc Gracie’s reaction was too funny - you can see this all on my story for a few more hours before Instagram gives it the boot.👢} Buuut yeah, moral of the story is don’t let one bad hair cut ruin your life (or the stylists)! It’s just hair. It grows back.😘 #hairstyles #hairdo #newhair #springhair#normalizebreastfeeding #normalizenursing #breastfed #breastfedbaby

I just want to brag about this man right here.😍 First of all, he's KILLING IT at work! He is so hardworking. I've been very stressed about buying our first home (biggest purchase I've EVER made) and being ready for our baby this summer.🏠👶🏼I don't know why we thought it'd be a good idea to just make two HUGE life changes all at once.🙈 I'm all about budgeting and planning - making sure we have enough money, resources, etc. I also want to be able to stay at home with our baby - my biggest dream in life has been to be a stay at home mommy.🤰🏼 This puts A LOT of pressure on Doug, but he is 100% supportive of me and my dreams. He could kinda care less about planning and he's always the optimistic one saying "it'll all work out." I'm sure I'm driving him NUTS wanting to talk it all out daily - but he's been so patient, loving, and caring....☺️Thank you so much hubby! I love you!😘 I'm SO excited to start this new chapter of our lives together. I love you more than life! 💕😍👶🏼🌈

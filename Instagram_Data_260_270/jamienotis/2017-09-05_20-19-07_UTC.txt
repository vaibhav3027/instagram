Spent the day getting newborn photos of my little Gracie Girl! 👶🏼🎀 We had to reschedule bc the first time @henleygracehehner had two ginormous poop explosions.💩...so @aliblakephotography (super patient - thank you!!!) came back today & captured some of the absolute cutest pics 🤗 ....but of course it wouldn't be the same without at least one more poop explosion.💩🤷🏼‍♀️🙈 And I'm THAT mom who took a pic for the funny memories to share with her one day.😜☺️More Behind The Scenes in my insta story.🤗 #newbornphotography #newborn #MyGracieGirl #soinlove

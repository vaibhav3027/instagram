My hubby and I are becoming more prepared for our sweet #babyhehner!👶🏼🌈 We created our registry at @buybuybaby - link in bio - and can I just tell you that creating a baby registry is extremely stressful if you're first time parents?! 😬 Wowzers - there is an option (or 10) for EVERYTHING.🙈 How do we know what is absolutely necessary and what's just "fluff?"🤔 When Doug and I first looked into creating a registry we literally walked in and then walked right back out. We were CLUELESS as to what was actually NEEDED and would be used. 🤷🏼‍♀️When we heard about @gugu_guru it was a no-brainer. They help you pick out baby essentials that fit your lifestyle.👍🏼 I share more about setting up a baby registry & Gugu Guru in my blog. Link in bio. And for the moms/ dads out there - is there any MUST HAVE that we should include on our registry??? Please share your advice. We are all ears!👂🏼😜👶🏼🌈 PS our gender reveal party is TOMORROW on @fyi at 8pm and YOU'RE INVITED!🎉 We can't wait to share what we're having with you! Boy or girl?? 🎀⚾️ #sp #ad

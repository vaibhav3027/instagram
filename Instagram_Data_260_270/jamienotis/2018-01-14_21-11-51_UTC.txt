Busiest. Weekend. Ever.🙈 Flew to LA Friday.✈️ Filmed Married At First Sight #Unfiltered all day yesterday.🎥 Immediately after, hopped on a plane to make it back home just in time for my sister in law’s baby shower today.☺️🤰🏼 ...phew! Got it all done!✅ It was so hard to leave my sweet girl....It feels SO good to have her in my arms again.👶🏼💖 Daddy clearly did a good job while I was away. ...just look at her face.💕

Oldie but goodie!✨ This pic was taken waaaay back when my season of Married At First Sight was on. ...I've said time & time again, Doug & I will forever be THANKFUL to #marriedatfirstsight & the experts who matched us.👰🏼🙏🏼 If it wasn't for them, we would have never met, we probably wouldn't be together still (no thanks to me & my scared-to-commit ways🙀🙈), and our sweet baby girl wouldn't be bouncing around in my belly!🤰🏼👶🏼We love them all so much ... so you can imagine my face 😁 when I heard @loganlevkoff will be our guest today on The Daily Glow at @littlethingsusa !!!💃🏻🎉🤗💗 I haven't seen her in years and I cannot wait to be reunited!!! And of course our #mafsFamily A.K.A #FRANS are invited to our reunion!🙌🏼 Join us today at 1pm on Little Things facebook page for our LIVE show!👯💕 #mafs #flashbackfriday #soexcited

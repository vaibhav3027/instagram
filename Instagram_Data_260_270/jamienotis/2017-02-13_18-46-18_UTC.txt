We are 12 weeks and 4 days (almost done with the first trimester)!!! And thank you to All of you who shared tips w/ me on how to take #babybump pics on my last couple posts. You guys are the BEST!💕What do you think? I think Doug and I have gotten a lot better at it! 🤗 I blogged (link in bio) about what we did to help improve odds of conception & different fun reveal ideas.👶🏼 This week we get a 3-D scan of #babyhehner. I can't wait to see how much this little one has grown!💞 #excited #happy #babybliss #baby #marriedlife PS yesterday I shared my very first #bumppic. As you can see my flat stomach has completely vanished and I couldn't be HAPPIER! #growingbaby #healthybaby

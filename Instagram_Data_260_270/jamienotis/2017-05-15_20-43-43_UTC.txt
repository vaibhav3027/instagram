Our little egg is not a little egg anymore!🤰🏼 She's a big, round cantaloupe now!🍈 It's so funny because for the first 6 months I just wanted to "look" more pregnant. Now that I do I literally do not have ANY clothes that fit.🙅🏼 I keep thinking I can just keep wearing my pre-pregnancy clothes bc up until like yesterday I could. (Well, shirts anyway.) Now buttons pop open and my belly hangs over.😳 BUT there is no better reason for not being able to fit into my clothes💗...I have ZERO complaints.🤗 This sweet baby girl can just keep growing and growing safe & happy inside me!👶🏼🌈 #25weeks #countdown #rainbowbaby

Oh the sweet memories of our wedding day. üë∞üèª‚ù§Ô∏è ... I never would've imagined on my wedding day that we'd be happily married-or married at all for that matter-a few days into our marriage. (It took a while to fall in love w my stranger hubby.) If you thought we were crazy for taking this wild chance, I'm happy to let you know that there are four couples who take the title CRAZY from us. (Thanks, guys!!!) üòä ..There's a new show on @fyi called #SevenYearSwitch ... these couples are all married and they SWAP PARTNERS in order to try to save their marriage! It's called "switch therapy." YIKES! I shouldn't call them nutso Bc everyone & their grandma told doug and me we were insane (but look where we are now - almost 3 years happily married!!!) This show premiered last week and it's so good I decided to blog about it. (Link in bio.) I feel like I've already learned life lessons for my own marriage by watching these couples. (Number one: do not attempt Switch therapy at home - you may end up divorced!) lol ... all joking aside, I'd love to hear your thoughts on this show. Would you ever swap partners to try to fix your marriage?? Do you  think it could work. Link to my blog in my bio. #marriedlife #love #marriedatfirstsight #mafs

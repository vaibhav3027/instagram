Labor & Delivery nurses ... after delivering.👶🏼💕 @jillmarkey & I were due two days apart & I ended up having Gracie on her daughter, Avery’s, due date.💫 Our daughter’s are like 6 hours apart so they’re basically twinsies.👯‍♀️ (We both went into labor during the eclipse!)🌖🌗🌒🌚🌝 PS - you’d never know she has FOUR babies 3 years old and under! Momma looks goooood!🙌🏼💃🏻💗 #nurselife #RN #nurse #laboranddelivery #nurses #nursesofinstagram

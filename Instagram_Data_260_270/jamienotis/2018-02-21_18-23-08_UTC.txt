This little love turns 6 mo old tomorrow!💘 Gah, where has the time gone? And how did she get so big.👶🏼🎀 I don’t post a lot of nursing pics bc honestly I don’t want the mommy shame.🙅🏻‍♀️ When I first began breastfeeding I was SO proud I’d post almost daily of my Gracie girl nursing ... until I began seeing comments like “no one needs to see your boob.” And “why don’t you cover up more?!” So I just stopped sharing. Which really annoys me now bc whyyy did I let these silly people get into my head??🙄 I’m not letting anyones opinions stop me anymore. I am SO PROUD that I’ve been able to nurse my baby exclusively for her first 6 months of life (my goal is 1 year). It’s so crazy to think that I GREW her in my body and the nutrients my body makes have been the only ones my baby’s had since she was born, yet she has grown healthy, strong & has stayed in the 75th percentile & higher since she was born. Gah, a woman’s body is so incredible & sooo much stronger than we realize!💪🏼 I never knew how terribly difficult breastfeeding would be. As a labor and delivery nurse I tell my patients all the time about how great breast milk is for their baby, I teach them how to get the correct latch, and I used to tell ‘em “if it hurts the latch isn’t correct” bc that’s what I learned in nursing school ...but I learned real fast after having my own baby that uhhh, yeah it’s gonna hurt at first.🤦🏻‍♀️ Our nipples aren’t used to so much attention!

Long story, short: ummm, breastfeeding is one of the most demanding, all-consuming jobs I’ve ever had. It hurts like a mother in the beginning - I literally cracked & bled for weeks. I had craters for nipples while they healed. And it hurt like H E ! ! for the first 2 months of Henley’s life.😫 BUT, sitting here now holding my happy, healthy, beautiful baby girl who is sleeping peacefully in my arms - nope, I wouldn’t change a thing.☺️ I’ve always said “Fed is best” bc let’s be honest, it doesn’t matter how you feed your baby as long as she eats! BUT, knowing that I - Lil ol me - have nurtured and nourished my sweet baby girl in every way I possibly know how makes me smile and feel so proud.💞 | 📸: @amandadollyphotography

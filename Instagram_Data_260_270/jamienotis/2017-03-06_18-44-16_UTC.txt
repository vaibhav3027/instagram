Lately I've been trying to spend more time off of my feet, and the pup takes this as an invite to cuddle.. I can't say that I mind!🤗 You guys know I love my tea but I've had to find less caffeinated since becoming pregnant.🤰🏼 I actually have had a bit of insomnia😴 (anyone else have this problem during pregnancy???) so I started drinking my @teamiblends Relax tea before bedtime to try to help me relax.. I heard chamomile and lavender is good for calming and luckily this tea has both! Best part, It's totally mom-to-be approved! If you have insomnia & you'd like to try it out, use OTIS for 10% off your order. Link in bio *And if you're new to teas the nurse in me wants to remind ya to always talk to your doctor - everyone is different and it's always better to be safe than sorry before trying anything new in pregnancy* 😍😘 #thankyouteami #teatime #calming #bedtime #sleep #insomnia #spon

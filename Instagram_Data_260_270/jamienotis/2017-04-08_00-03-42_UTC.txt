We are HALFWAY there!👶🏼🌈 We are getting closer and closer to meeting our sweet #rainbowbaby.💗 At first I felt "flutters" or "butterflies" but now I am feeling full blown kicks ...I'm literally feeling this baby moving and kicking inside me as I post this #babybump pic!!! It is the BEST feeling in the world!✨ (I know when this kiddo gets bigger it may hurt, but right now I an in AWE of the feeling of my baby bouncing and dancing inside me.🤗 It's truly such an INCREDIBLE feeling!)💙 Daddy felt the baby kick for the first time this week, too!!💞 This is truly the best journey we've ever been on. Each week gets better and better!🤰🏼☺️ #20weeks

#latergram - I was packing for LA & Doug snapped this pic as I was grabbing my vitamins.😝 He thinks I’m a health freak bc I literally won’t go a day without taking my vitamins, but as a registered nurse I know vitamins are super important.💗 ...The only thing that’s tough is there’s a vitamin/supplement out there for everything.🙃 I wanted to know exactly what I should be taking for MY body so I took a short quiz on takecareof.com & now every month I get vitamin packs delivered to our house that include everything I need for breastfeeding & to help improve my hair, skin, bones ...literally everything I want to focus on post pregnancy!🙌🏼 I didn't have to worry about missing something bc they put everything together in one travel-friendly vitamin pack specifically for me.👍🏼 I'm trying to be the healthiest momma for my baby girl (and for me)! If you've been wanting to get healthier I def recommend checking this out and I've got a discount code for ya: use JAMIE25  if you want 25% off your first purchase.😘I also put the link in my bio if you wanna take the quiz to see what you need for your bod.😻 #begoodtoyou #takeyourvitamins #ad #careof

We had an AMAZING day celebrating Mother's Day.💐 Now I'm back in my fav outfit - my robe!😜 Before today ends I just wanted to take a moment to thank this woman right here. She is the true definition of selflessness. She gives and gives and then gives some more. She's the first person to show up when you need someone and the last to judge you if you're having a bad day. I always wanted to marry into a huge, loving family and sometimes I just pinch myself that my dreams have come true.☺️ Im so happy to have my mother in laws guidance with my baby and I'm SO happy my sweet girl will have such an amazing & loving grandma.🤗💗 #thankful #blessed #HappyMothersDay #mothersdayweekend #mothersday

After meeting my hubby in this dress - as a stranger👰🏼 - never could have imagined that 3 1/2 years later our baby girl would be laying on it smiling back at her mommy & daddy.👶🏼💗 Love comes when you least expect it...and sometimes in the strangest ways.💕...posted more pics of @henleygracehehner with my wedding dress in my story.💖| 📷: @amandadollyphotography

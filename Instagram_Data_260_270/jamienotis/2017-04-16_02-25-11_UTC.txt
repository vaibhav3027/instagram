✨Real Life: The night before Easter & I'm laying in bed with my hand on my belly.🤰🏼 I cannot pry my hand away from these incredible movements that I can feel on the inside & now outside, too! Now I know why women hold their belly when they're pregnant.😍I don't want to miss feeling a kick from this little one.🌟It's the most wonderful experience to FEEL your baby happily bouncing around inside you.☺️ It's amazing to think that this time next year we will have a 7 mo old baby who we'll be making an Easter basket for!👶🏼🌈 Oh my goodness, I am SO excited to become a mommy!!!💃🏻🙌🏼😍

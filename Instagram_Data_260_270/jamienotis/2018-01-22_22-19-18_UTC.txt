‼️G I V E A W A Y ‼️{CONGRATS @_cruzsotelogarciia ... you won!!! 🙌🏼💃🏻🤗 Giveaway now closed.}Ok, so I don’t usually post twice in one day - but this giveaway is too EPIC to wait!🌟 Think new mom, soon to be momma, baby shower gift idea, ...heck, even mommas of several kiddos could use this!🤗 Here’s what you can win:
🍼New Philips Avent breast pump (!!!)
👶🏼Philips Avent Bottle Warmer
🍼Philips Avent Soothies
👶🏼Philips Avent Natural bottle
🍼Philips Avent Anti-Colic bottle with AirFree vent

I’ve gotta tell ya, #PhilipsAvent “natural” bottle has been a legit lifesaver for me with my daughter.🙏🏻 I just chatted with the pediatrician who introduced me to these bottles last month on my insta LIVE & asked her all of your questions - if you missed her advice live don’t worry bc it’ll stay there for 24 hours & you can go watch it now.💕 I was having so much trouble getting Gracie to take to a bottle but with the “natural” she hasn’t had any issues.🙏🏻 I think it’s because the nipple is soft like skin? Or maybe bc it’s a wide based nipple so it’s a similar latch as when she nurses? I don’t know exactly why, but I know a lot of mommas have this issue & I want to be able to help more moms so I partnered with Philips Avent.👶🏼 If you’re having bottle trouble I definitely recommend trying these bottles - and if you’re pumping you’ve gotta try the new breast pump! Life changing. I promise. (If you want more info I actually blogged about it about a mo ago, but i put the link in my bio for ya.) 🍼

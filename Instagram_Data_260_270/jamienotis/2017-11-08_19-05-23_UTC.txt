I’m 2 weeks late posting this🙈, but my sweet baby is TWO months old!💞 I cannot believe how fast time is flying. She is getting SO big.😭 She loves looking into our eyes and watching her mommy & daddy talk & sing to her.😍 She tries to mimic our voices already. She hates tummy time, but loves holding her head high and looking around.👀 Her favorite time is definitely bath time!🐳 My favorite time is when she looks into our eyes and smiles & coos back at us. Making her smile is my best accomplishment in life.💖 @henleygracehehner PS thank you to our Fran for sending her this adorable outfit.💗

After graduating nursing school there were two areas I wanted to work in: labor & delivery & pediatric oncology. I began working in labor & delivery & I love it so much I'm still there, but my heart still wants to help those sweet kiddos with cancer.ðŸ’— That's why I am a proud supporter of @loveyourmelon! Love Your Melon is an apparel brand dedicated to giving a hat to every child battling cancer in America as well as giving 50% of profit from sales to their nonprofit partners.To date, they have given over 2.6 million dollars and over 110,000 hats to children battling cancer. Together, we will change the lives of children battling cancer one beanie at a time.ðŸ’• #LoveYourMelon #JoinThe Story #lym_iun

We still do {and always will}💖Three years ago we renewed our wedding vows.👰🏼 We have a very interesting story🧐 to tell our daughter when she is old enough to understand.👶🏼🎀 Love comes in the strangest ways and when you least expect it if you keep your heart & mind open to it.💗(And having a SUPER loving & patient stranger hubby is helpful too.)😂☺️💕 Happy vow renewal anniversary, hubs! I LOVE you beyond words.💋 You have been my biggest blessing in life. Gah, I could gush over you endlessly. You’re simply the best.✨ You and Henley are my everything. I love you!😘 I’m excited for DALLAS this weekend!☀️ @henleygracehehner

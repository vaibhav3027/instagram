Doug has been “mistakenly” grabbing my @teamiblends tumblers full of tea but I’m on to him.👀 Gracie will be 6 months in 2 days.💞 S I X months! Where has the time gone?🤷🏻‍♀️ Last night Doug and I looked at each other like "Wow, we did it! We've kept a baby alive for half a year AND she's happy!" But for me - the past six months have been full of sleepy eyes & food cravings that no one warned me about! 😂 Especially because I am still exclusively nursing. I'm on the 30 day slim down and trying to avoid sweets.🙅🏻‍♀️ @teamiblends Skinny tea was my go-to while pregnant because it gave me energy with only the tiny bit of plant-based caffeine. Lately though, I’m REALLY relying on it to help me curb those cravings that strike hourly lol. So I make sure to drink the Skinny tea 1-2 times every day and it helps SO much! If you haven’t tried it, you need to! Use OTIS for 15% off yours 💕 For those asking: the site is TeamiBlends.com 💘 #thankyouteami #momlife #lifesaver

SO EXCITED!💃🏻🎅🏼 We have our annual ugly sweater holiday cards ALL READY to be sent out!🎄 Thank YOU for helping us choose a pic - we went with the one with @henleygracehehner sticking her cute little tongue out)😛 This year we wanted a quality card stock and when we used @plymouthcards for Gracie’s birth announcement it was a huge hit so we decided to use them again.🤗 Everyone loved that the cards are able to be framed! (I love that too so they don’t just get thrown away after the holidays.) We were able to custom make our holiday cards without having a minimum which was nice too.👍🏼 If you’re looking for a unique & inexpensive, yet high quality holiday card check out @plymouthcards & you can use the code ‘HOHO20’ for 20% off!🎅🏼 Link in bio for ya.☺️ #merrychristmas #happyholidays #christmascard #babysfirstchristmas #ad

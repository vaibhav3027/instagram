Don't let the smile fool you, working while this prego isn't easy!🤰🏼 I'm *finally* on #maternityleave 🙌🏼 but 12 hour shifts during pregnancy is rough! I've been very careful during my pregnancy to give my body everything it needs to feel good and healthy! When I first got pregnant I sought out @teamiblends tea because I needed a natural energy source that would help me clear head fog. (That "pregnancy brain" thing is so real!)🙈😜 I got their Alive blend and it's been a lifesaver when I have mom brain. (I love that I can say mom!) ❤️ If you want you can use code JAMIEO for 15% off yours - I threw the link to Teami in my bio for ya, too!🤗 ...And always chat with your doc before trying anything new in your pregnancy.☺️ My doc told me it's 100% safe, but every pregnancy is different. 🤰🏼👶🏼 #thankyouteami #nurselife #rn #nurse #ad

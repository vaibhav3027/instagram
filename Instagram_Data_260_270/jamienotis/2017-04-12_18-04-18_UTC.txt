One of my favorite photos from my sis in law's wedding.👰🏼 It was one of the most FUN and HAPPY weddings I've ever been to.🎉...Doug would say that's because they're so old school and knew & loved each other before their wedding....I'd tell Doug that joke of his is getting old now.😜 (But secretly I'd be thinking he's SO right...our wedding was a completely different scene 🙈 but that's because I was absolutely TERRIFIED to marry a complete stranger!🙅🏼🤦🏻‍♀️....wish I knew then what I know now.☺️ Had I known how kind, loving, and patient my stranger hubby is - and that we'd be starting our own little family together within 3 years - it would have been the best day of my life!💞 ...#21weeks pregnant TOMORROW!👶🏼🌈 Hindsight is 20/20, right?!👀

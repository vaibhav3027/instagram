My mom met our daughter.💖 ...I’m so happy Gracie got to meet her grandma.💜 (If you saw our last episode then you know I was super nervous - but it went so great! Baby steps towards healing.)☺️ Love you momma!💓 Last two episodes of Married At First Sight: Jamie And Doug Plus One tomorrow at 10 on @lifetimetv - set your DVRS!💕 PS - how many heart emojis can I use for this?!❣️😻😂

Seeing all the photos of the thousands of families affected by #hurricaneharvey is absolutely heart breaking. ðŸ’” As a new mommy, I couldn't imagine having to climb to higher ground, or tread through water with my newborn baby and 2 dogs - Yet there are so many families doing this.ðŸ˜° If you want to join us in helping these families affected by Harvey visit redcross.org/lifetime or text #Harvey to 90999 to make a $10 donation.ðŸ’—#dayofgiving #prayfortexas #repost @doughehner

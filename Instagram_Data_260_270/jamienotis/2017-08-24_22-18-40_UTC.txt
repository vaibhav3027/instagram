Today is our DUE DATE ... 🤰🏼 We were scheduled for an induction on 8/29 & I really didn't think she'd come before then. I couldn't be happier to have my precious @henleygracehehner in my arms healthy & happy....at HOME!👶🏼 We were discharged today - tonight's our very first night at home together just us.☺️😬 Wish us luck! 🙏🏼💗 #sheshere #sohappy #learningaswego #parenting

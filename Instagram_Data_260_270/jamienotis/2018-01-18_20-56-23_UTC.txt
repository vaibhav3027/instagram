“Heaven sent with a kiss from my big brother Johnathan.”😘 This sweet girl is FOUR months old (for one more week).🤗 She turned 4 mo old two days after her big brother in heaven would have turned one had Johnathan made it to his due date.👼🏼 I’ve gotta be honest, lately I’ve been in such a funk.🙃 I blame the weather, lack of sleep, being super busy, ... I’m sure all of that plays a role, but I find myself wondering what he would have been like.💙 Would he be full of energy & running around like crazy or would he be calm & relaxed playing with cars & trucks?🏎 Would he look like Gracie? I thought after a year of him gone I’d get “over it” but can you ever really get over this type of loss?😞 ...whenever I find myself going down the tunnel of sadness I look at this beautiful, happy baby girl and smile.👶🏼🌈 I am so thankful that her big brother sent her to us & I know he’s watching over her.💚 She is our absolute EVERYTHING & I love being her mommy.☺️ PS how cute are these faces that she makes?!?💖 PPS thank you to our Frans who mailed us the adorable onesie, tutu, & bow. We are beyond blessed to have y’all in our lives.💕#4monthsold #happybaby #johnathanedward #alwaysinourhearts #pregnancylossawareness

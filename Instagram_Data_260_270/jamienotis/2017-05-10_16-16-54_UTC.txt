Happy Nurses Week to all my fellow nurses.💗And guess what?! I have some super duper EXCITING news to share with ya!🎉 I am FINALLY putting my scrubs back on ... I'm orienting at a hospital in NJ! When Doug and I moved out of NYC it was super difficult to work 12 hr night shifts at my hospital there and then drive the hour commute home...and forget it now that I'm preggers!😜 #toolazy ... So I began applying for my jersey license...once I got that I began searching for the perfect hospital for me. I am SO EXCITED to be back on the labor and delivery unit.🤗💕 It's my lunch break now and I'm literally hanging out in the parking lot about to take a nap in my car.😴 This momma is TIRED .... but so excited too!🎉👯💃🏻🤗 #registerednurse #rn #nurse #nursesweek

Pregnancy Truths: my skin is taking a beating. 😏 I cannot be HAPPIER for my little #babybump to grow, but geesh - my skin is beyond itchy, dry, and I'm breaking out in the worse way...and it's not just my face.😩 (Thank goodness for makeup!💃🏻 I've switched to vegan, botanically based products to help with this...if you're interested in learning more watch my Facebook live tonight!)💕 I've learned that clothes that don't allow your skin to breathe make you itch even more. If I could live in underwear and my robe, I would.😛 ..Buuuut since it's frowned upon to walk around in underwear I've been on a mission to find cute clothes that are A) affordable B) my #bump can grow and BREATHE in and C) are cute too. I found this awesome dress and it's literally PERFECT! It's great for spring too! And my fave part about it - it's not even $18 bucks!!👯🎉 ($17 and some change.) This isn't even a maternity dress ... which to me makes it even better bc I'll be able to wear it even after I have my sweet baby.🤰🏼 I was actually wearing this dress the other day for a Facebook live and SO MANY of you commented on it. ...so I figured I'd do ya a favor and share the deets! If you are part of @liketoknow.it then all you have to do is "like" this pic or screenshot the image and you'll get all of my outfit details emailed directly to ya. If not, just download the free #liketkitapp. ...I'm so happy to share great outfit deals with you guys and I figured if I found a cute, comfy dress for less than $20 It'd be rude of me not to share w my frans!💁🏼💃🏻😘 Hope you love it as much as me. See ya later on Facebook live!💞 #ootd #springfashion #maxidress #jeanjacket #LTKSaleAlert #LTKStyleTip#LTKUnder100 #pregnancy # preggers #pregnancyfashion #fashion #LTKFit #LTKShoeCrush http://liketk.it/2qUyE

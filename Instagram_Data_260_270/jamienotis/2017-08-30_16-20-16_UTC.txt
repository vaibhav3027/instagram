Does anyone else struggle opening up that red button on the car seat!? 🤦‍♀️ I just found out about The Car Seat Key and got two - one for me & one for my sister. She suffers from carpal tunnel & has so much pain in her hands...this Car Seat Key makes it SO much easier to get babies out of the car seat...Definitely a must have on your keys! 🙌 I put the link in my bio (thecarseatkey.com) if you want more info on @thecarseatkey - you can use promo code JAMIE20 for 20% off your order. 👏 And about that baby ... we needed one for the parenting class we went to (Doug practiced changing it's diaper & swaddling her - he has a stellar swaddle if I may say so myself!)😜☺️💗 #freethebaby #stopthestruggle #ad

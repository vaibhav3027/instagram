This little love is THREE months old!🦄 She holds her head all by herself, is almost fully rolling over, & has discovered her feet!☺️ She loves bath time 🐳 & when mommy & daddy sing to her, but she still doesn’t like tummy time very much.🙅🏻‍♀️ Shes been a bit fussy at night lately so we think she may be teething already!🙈 ...she’s the best part of our day every. single. day. 💖

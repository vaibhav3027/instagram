Alert‼️This is LONG,but I just sat here for 10 min writing it in hopes it's helpful for you❣️...No one ever wants to hear someone complain 🙅🏼 (me included) so I've kept my whining to myself. (Well, mostly.😜 Truth be told: My poor hubby gets to hear it all too often.🙊) I've been beyond exhausted All.The.Time.😴 I have hypothyroidism and ever since becoming pregnant my docs & I've had a tough time managing it. I kinda thought in the beginning it was just the first trimester sleepiness.🤰🏼 Then when the second trimester came and I was only becoming more and more tired I began to feel just kinda lazy.😩 I mean, I climb in bed every chance I can get.😴 I wondered if maybe I was depressed?🤔 That couldn't be it though bc I am SO HAPPY to have my sweet baby girl rolling around inside me!👶🏼🌈 My thyroid has been out of whack, but not like in some huge, scary way. Nothing was really standing out as to why I'm soooo tired all the time so I kinda chalked it up to being pregnant with a busy schedule & hypothyroidism. ...until I met with an NP at my doc appointment yesterday. She said that I could have this disease called Hashimotos. She drew my labs and sent me home with a list of books I should read on hypothyroidism & Hashimotos. She also said I should eliminate all gluten & dairy. It was like a revelation to me.💡 I went straight to the book store and began reading on it all. 📚 I want to share my story bc she said that A LOT of women (and men) have these same symptoms & are misdiagnosed since they're the same as depression/anxiety. Just thought if you've been struggling with similar symptoms & you're clueless this could help ya out. ☺️👍🏼 I SO wish someone had shared with me earlier!💗#hypothyroidism #hashimotos #hashimotosdisease

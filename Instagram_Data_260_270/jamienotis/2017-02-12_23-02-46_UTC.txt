So this is the very first #babybump photo I took. I finally got a flat stomach (after months of trying to shed the 20 pounds I gained with my first pregnancy) and I find out I'm pregnant again ... I guess some would be miserable to know that their flat stomach would be gone in weeks but I really couldn't have been happier!💙🤗💕 (And yep, that flat stomach is definitely GONE! I'll show you my current baby bump next!)💞PS thank you to you ladies who shared with me the tips and tricks for taking #bump pics. @doughehner & I've been practicing.❤️👶🏼 #pregnant #pregnantbelly #happy #marriedlife

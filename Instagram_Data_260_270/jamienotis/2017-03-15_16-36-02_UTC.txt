"I could conquer the world with one hand as long as you are holding the other." ... hubby, thanks for holding my hand tight as we conquer this pregnancy together.💕🤗 I really think I'm beginning to feel our baby hehner moving inside me.🤰🏼 It's just little twitches or flutters (not sure how exactly to explain it) but I LOVE this feeling!!! It's so incredible.☺️ I can't wait until I feel real kicks!👶🏼🌈 #marriedlife #pregnant #pregnancy #rainbowbaby #babylove #babyhehner

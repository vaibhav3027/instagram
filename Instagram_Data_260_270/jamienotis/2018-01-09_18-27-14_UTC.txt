My story to finding happily ever after is very different than most.🙊 My hubby and I weren’t high school sweethearts & we never met in college.🙅🏻‍♀️ We didn’t run into each other at a bar or a sporting event.🤷🏻‍♀️ We never had a first date prior to saying “I do.”👰🏼 ..we didn’t even know each other’s names.😳 Yet, here we are. With the most beautiful baby & incredible life together.💖 When I slipped this wedding dress on nearly 4 years ago to be married at first sight never in my wildest dreams could I truly believe it’d lead me here today, with my precious daughter happily laying on it gazing back at me.👶🏼🎀 It’s definitely incredible that we can watch the very first time we met, our very first kiss, first dance, first EVERYTHING bc it was all documented on Married At First Sight.🎥 And now we get to watch & relive our baby’s first months (and us fumble as first-time parents😛) on #jamieanddougplusone!🤗Tonight at 10EST on @lifetimetv are the last two episodes of this season. We are so happy to continue sharing our story with all of our Frans (you guys are seriously the BEST!) & we hope you’ll watch with us tonight, so set your DVR’s❣️...our story just goes to show - if you’re out there looking for true love & happiness, you never know where you may find it.💗

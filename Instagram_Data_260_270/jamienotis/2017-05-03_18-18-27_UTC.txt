Pregnancy Truth: I've already gained 20 pounds this pregnancy.🙈 I don't even know how. I had gained 12 in my first trimester and I had hoped it'd slow down by second trimester ...but the pounds just keep comin'😩 I want nothing more than my baby to be happy and healthy, but I was kinda hoping to avoid a huge weight gain.🙏🏼 Truth be told, I haven't been the best at exercising & eating healthy.😬 I eat more sweets now than ever 🍭🎂🍦 But, I want to be HEALTHY for my baby.👶🏼🌈 I NEED to be physically fit & strong for the day I deliver her.💪🏼 So, I'm publicly vowing to start choosing better habits. We haven't shared much about this - but we are in the process of buying our first home.🏡 A.K.A we are saving every dime right now!😜 I know gyms can be uber expensive, but I've researched @planetfitness & I've found that it's a very affordable gym .... they have a Mother's Day special for $5 down and only $10 a month after. So - no excuses.🙅🏼 I'm holding myself accountable to choosing healthiness for the rest of my pregnancy.🤰🏼 For me & for my sweet baby girl. 🤗💕🎀 I blogged more about this ... Link in bio. If you have any fav gym routines or working out tips, I'm all ears! Please share with me because I've been trying #yoga, but it's a lot harder than it looks! 👀 #23weeks #judgementfreezone #planetfitness #ad

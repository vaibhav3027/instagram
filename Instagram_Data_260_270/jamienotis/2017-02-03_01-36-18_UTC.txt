It's amazing how fast babies grow. 💞 We are 11 weeks today & had a check up. (I'm holding the pic of the baby from today.) Our baby has literally doubled in size from two weeks ago (pic of baby Doug's holding). So incredible. 🤗👶🏼 #preggers #pregnant #rainbowbaby #babylove PS .. @people has done it again. Made me cry so many tears of joy watching @doughehner's reaction when I told him we are pregnant...☺️💕 link in bio.

Full blown third trimester belly!🤰🏼🤗💗 I've been trying to find *cute* clothes that fit - and will last longer than just a couple months!👗 ...True  definition of #TheStruggleIsReal! 😝 I just found @baethelabel - they cover maternity AND motherhood.🙌🏼 Their style is made for the modern mom and transition from #bump to #postpartum!💃🏻I got this dress and another one (I'll post in my story so you can see) ... I think they're super cute & I LOVE how they hug my baby bump!☺️ #baethelabel #bellybump #ad

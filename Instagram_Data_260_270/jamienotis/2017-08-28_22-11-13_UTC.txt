Two weeks before our sweet @henleygracehehner arrived🤰🏼 ... I remember wondering what it'd feel like to hold her in my arms & be able to sing to her and rock her to sleep ....I'm holding her right now and there are just no words. Love, peace, happiness, BLISS ... every inch of my body is just so thankful & so, so relaxed..☺️ When they say "Worth The Wait" I totally know what they mean now. 👶🏼🌈 #MyGracieGirl #worththewait #myeverything 📸: @aliblakephotography #greatphotographer 🙌🏼 PS a couple more pics are in my insta story!🤗

Spending the weekend in Chicago interviewing the new couples of Married At First Sight for another season of Unfiltered!👰🏼💃🏻😻 ..There were SO many great moments today (you HAVE to see unfiltered on @lifetimetv on thursdays at 8:45 pm) but my personal favorite was seeing my foodie friend @everythingerica.👯😋💃🏻Not only is she beautiful & SUPER intelligent but she can whip anything up in the kitchen!😋🎉👌🏼

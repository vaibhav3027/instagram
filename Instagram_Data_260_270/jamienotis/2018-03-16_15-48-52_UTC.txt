Gracie’s FIRST St. Patrick’s day weekend!🍀 This is random, but seeing her look up and smile as we kiss makes me so happy. To know she is growing up in a home where she witnesses a loving, respectful, kind daddy who makes mommy laugh.☺️ And a mommy who falls more in love with her daddy everyday makes my heart happy. Anyone who grew up with the opposite knows exactly what I mean.💘 Happy St. Patrick’s Day!💚 PS if you like #giveaways check out my story.😉

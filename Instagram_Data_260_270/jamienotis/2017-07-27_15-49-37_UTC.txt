We are officially 9 MONTHS PREGNANT today!!!🎉Oh my goodness - I can't believe it!🤗 ...so excited (and so nervous🙊)!!! I'm sitting in the doc office for a check up right now & Doug just text me this pic from a couple weeks ago - doubt I'd be able to get on his shoulders now!😂No horsing around for us anymore - we have SO much to do!! I challenged him to see who can assemble baby gear faster - me or him. (He thinks he can but he is totally going to lose - he's never even changed a diaper!)😜Tomorrow night at 6:30pm we are going LIVE on Facebook! Join us in on the fun of preparing for our baby who is #COMINGSOON! 👶🏼🌈 #36weekspregnant #countdownison #homestretch

Don't let my super SLEEPY eyes fool ya - I am SO excited!!! We had the most amazing weekend.🤗💕 We began house hunting (again) and found a couple homes we LOVE! Yay!! All that house-hunting has wore me out though! ...It's not even 9 pm and I'm in my PJs ready to go to sleep! This momma is TIRED! Who said you get so much energy in the second trimester?? When will my burst of energy come?? Lol. At least my hubs will sit in bed to do his work while I go to sleep. He's the best. 🤗 😴😍👶🏼 #househunting #marriedlife #babylove #babybliss #babyhehner #rainbowbaby #babyprep

15 weeks!😊 I truly haven't been overly worried with this pregnancy. I think bc it has been completely different than my first I've felt confident this baby will grow safe and sound inside me ... I haven't had any spotting, bleeding or clots so I've felt like I am having a healthier pregnancy this time... I haven't had any cramping either .... at least not until yesterday.😩 I began the slightest cramping & they've lasted two full days now.🙁They're really mild cramps so I'm sure it's nothing (my doc says baby and I are absolutely fine) but for whatever reason I've been really nervous. We lost our angel Johnathan at 17 weeks, 1 day.😓 I just want to get past 17 weeks and feel this baby move.🙏🏼 I want to know our sweet baby is safe, healthy, and happy growing inside me.🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼 Being pregnant is one one of the most joyous experiences, but it's also one of the scariest. 😔 #growbabygrow #babyhehner #prayingforhealthybaby #marriedlife #pregnant #pregnancy #babybump

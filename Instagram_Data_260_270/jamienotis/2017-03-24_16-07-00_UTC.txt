We are 18 weeks pregnant!✨I cannot even believe it - we are almost half way there! 🤗 Our baby is 5 1/2 inches long and is yawning, hiccuping, sucking, and swallowing.😍 And at our last doc visit we saw this little one dancing inside me. She/he was bouncing all over the place! 👶🏼🌈 I've gotta tell ya, its such an AMAZING feeling to know our little baby is healthy, happy, and growing inside me.🙏🏼💕 #thankful #blessed #rainbowbaby #babybump #bumpstyle #bump #18weeks #growbabygrow #growingbump

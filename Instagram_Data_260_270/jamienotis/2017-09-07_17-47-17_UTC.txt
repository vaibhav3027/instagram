#fabfitfunpartner Took Gracie to her two week check up yesterday (she's gained 11 ounces!🙌🏼) & when I got home my @fabfitfun fall box was waiting on my doorstep!💃🏻 Since becoming a mommy I've had ZERO time for me🤷🏻‍♀️ (and I'm 100% ok with that) but I keep hearing how important it is to take care of me so that I can take care of her - well, I took the advice & spent at least 30 minutes going through my FFF box!🤗 I am currently obsessed with my new creamy Trestique Lip Crayon!💄 It’s only 1 of the 10 items in this season’s box - I don't even know how they fit so many goodies in one box, but I just LOVE getting these little gifts for myself. If you wanna subscribe for this box too you can use my coupon code JAMIE10 to get $10 off!💋 Link for more info is in my bio for ya. I'm going to do a Facebook LIVE today! I'm aiming for around 3 PM EST but if @henleygracehehner gets hangry then it may be a bit later - but I'm excited to see you all soon!💗#fabfitfun #fallfashion #fallweather #ad

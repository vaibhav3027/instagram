Yesterday was such a doozy for me.🤢 Sorry I was totally MIA on social media. I've been feeling SO good this pregnancy - my only complaint has been fatigue - until yesterday.🤕 I don't know what happened but I was SO nauseous, vomiting, and just so sick.🤒 I feel a bit better today, but still so nauseous. This morning hubs and I did a little relaxing couples yoga. Pregnancy is definitely not always easy, but our little baby girl is worth it all! 👶🏼🎀🌈

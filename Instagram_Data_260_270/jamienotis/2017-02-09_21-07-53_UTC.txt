Hubby and I were with @people yesterday chatting about a potential baby name. We aren't certain of anything yet - first we need to know the gender. 💕👶🏼 If you read my book #wifey101, you definitely already know all about this name. If not, follow link in my bio and Let us know what you think! 💞 PS I remember my sis in law would say she felt "fat" rather than pregnant bc her belly didn't quite pop but it was no longer flat. I thought she was nuts because she was pregnant. ....I totally get it now.😬 lol  #boyorgirl #babyhehner #peoplenow #marriedlife #preggers

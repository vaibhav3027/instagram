I am SO excited to announce my new (and FIRST) team member! @dietitiangonewild joined my #Arbonne team!👯🎉💕 Danielle and I met on the set of Married At First Sight: Unfiltered. (Yes, she is one of the new brides on MAFS that I interview on the show.)👰🏼 As the host I grilled and grilled and GRILLED her on topics like marrying a stranger, when/if she wants to consummate her marriage, and many more uncomfortable/personal subjects.🙈 The least I could do is share an AMAZING product, incredible company, and wonderful opportunity with her after.💚 I heard about Arbonne's Pure, Safe, Beneficial philosophy a couple years ago. I was intrigued.🤔 I heard these products are "safe" for you and your family...what does that even mean? Well, a lot of products we use daily have terrible, disease & cancer causing ingredients...for real.😨 I didn't know this.😱 Arbonne is Swiss-based and has the HIGHEST standards with QUALITY ingredients. I hope to help more families everywhere become aware of these unsafe products so they can decide if they'd prefer to use safer products. I shared this with Danielle...as a dietitian I knew she'd "get it." She tried Arbonne and LOVES it!💃🏻 She especially likes the RE9 skin care line - which isn't surprising since it's one of the highest rated skin care lines world wide. (Good bye, wrinkles!) 💁🏼 Now Danielle's on a mission to help families choose pure, safe, & beneficial ingredients as well!💃🏻 Go figure, the Registered Nurse and the Registered Dietitian join forces to do their best to help families everywhere. 🙌🏼💚💕 Yay, Danielle!

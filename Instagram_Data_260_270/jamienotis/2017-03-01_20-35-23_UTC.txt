My hubby wrote a blog about our #rainbowbaby and how he's really feeling inside. (Link in bio) He's such a strong man (and always puts on a tough front) so I really had no idea he was struggling so much.😢 When we found out we were pregnant again we really wanted to "choose happiness" over fear during our whole pregnancy. I'd like to paste a smile on our faces and say we've achieved that 100% - but I guess we are only human and after losing our sweet angel, the fear still creeps up on us for our rainbow baby, too. I just didn't realize my hubby was struggling so deeply. On a positive note, this baby has been absolutely healthy and strong at every single doctor visit and we fall more in love each and every day. I cant wait until we hold him/her in our arms safe and sound.👶🏼💕🌈 we find out if it's a boy or girl soon, too!🎀⚓️ ...I shared his blog on my site. I'm really proud of him for opening up and talking about it. I feel like it's really therapeutic and healthy.💕Link in bio. #babyhehner #johnathanedward #weloveyou #angelbaby

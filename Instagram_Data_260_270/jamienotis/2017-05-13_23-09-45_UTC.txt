My hubby surprised me with the SWEETEST Mother's Day gift this morning.🤗🎉 ... We're all about capturing the moment! (Wish I had known he was gonna capture this one ahead time since I was only in my robe - and had zero make up & hair done - but it was SO sweet!) I could watch the video he posted on his insta over and over again. 😍👶🏼🌈 #HappyMothersDay everyone!!! 💕 Thank you again hubby!💗@doughehner

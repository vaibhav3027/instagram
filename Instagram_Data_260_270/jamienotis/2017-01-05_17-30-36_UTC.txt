#tbt ... to NYE when my hubby and I shared a kiss in the center of Times Square....such a special night! Simply magical. 😍❤️ #happynewyear #love #marriedlife #marriedatfirstsight #mafs @doughehner {p.s. Never mind the 'happy new year' paraphernalia he stuffed on my back ... I didn't realize until now. ...I swear, he's just a big kid!) 😝 📷: @fyi

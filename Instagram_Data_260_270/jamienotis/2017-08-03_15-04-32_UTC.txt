Woke up this morning with messy hair, tears in my eyes, yesterday's mascara smeared all over, and a HUGE SMILE on my face.💜 I got the "you're 37 weeks pregnant today!" notification.🤰🏼🙏🏼I just looked up to heaven and thanked God & our angel baby, Johnathan, for protecting the little miracle moving inside me.👶🏼💗 We did it! We made it to "early full-term!"🌈 I immediately told Doug we need to take our baby bump pic .. didn't even brush my hair or wash my face!🙈 I don't even care though - I'm just so excited!🙌🏼💜 My goal is to let her continue to grow & develop safely inside me until at least 39 weeks, which is considered "full term."💗 Tonight we have a fun name reveal planned for you guys! We'll be LIVE on fb (link in bio) at 7pm EST.🙌🏼🤰🏼💕

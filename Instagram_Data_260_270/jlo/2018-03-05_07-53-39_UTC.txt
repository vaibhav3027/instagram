So today I spent the day in the Bronx at Yankee stadium with a very special group of people for a very impactful project called @projectdestined. The project teaches financial literacy to children in neighborhoods like I grew up in... so people from Harvard business school teach and mentor these kids on how to buy and own real estate and by the end of the program they own a part of a building in their own community in which the profits they make go toward their college educations...it shows them they have a choice they don’t have to be a tenant...you can be an owner!!! But it’s so much more than I could ever write here... it’s a game changer for anyone to be apart of this program! I am proud to be a part of it along with @arod (and if you look closely you will see a Supreme Court judge, Bronx Borough President, President of Blackstone, Yankee legend Mariano Rivera and so many more) here on a Sunday to be part of letting these kids know that anything is possible and sky is the limit!!! #todaywasagoodday #empoweringouryouth #empoweringourcommunity #givebacktime #mentorship

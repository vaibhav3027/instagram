I saw this and it broke my heart... this little boy is suiffering at the hand of bullies like so many other little boys and girls... but you are not alone Keaton we are here. There is no room in this world for bullying or hate of any kind. And we will overcome it with love... As a parent it is my responsibility to make sure my kids know it is ok to go to an adult when someone is treating them in a way that hurts them or makes them uncomfortable or unhappy in anyway. Also to educate and teach them to treat people with kindness, love and respect no matter how different they may be from you!! #loveistheanswer #lovealwayswins #youarenotalone #bulliessuck #teachlove

Hey everyone! I've been selected to be this week's judge for the @Niche hashtag project, along with @brianmcw The theme: street photography! For the next three days, tag your street pics with #NicheOnTheStreet and @Niche. On Monday, @Niche will post the featured photo. Note: only shots taken between now and Monday are eligible. Good luck!

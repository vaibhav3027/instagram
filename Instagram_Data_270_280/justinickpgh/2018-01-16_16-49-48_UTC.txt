The most important of our new year resolutions was to have 2018 filled with laughter and a ton of love. Happy to say it’s off to a better start than our gym goal resolutions. 🤫 Aside from that, Nick has a goal to improve his make up skills, and Justin is reading one book a month on astrophysics (he loves outer space). What are some unique resolutions you guys have? Let us know! ♥️

Weâ€™ve been together for over three years now, and each day is an adventure. So while we donâ€™t particularly celebrate Valentineâ€™s Day, we cherish it as just another day out of 365 where we give each other love and constant support. OKAY, now that we are done being sappy, can we talk about how Luna obviously hates us and Valentineâ€™s Day?! ðŸ˜¾ Tag a friend who feels like Luna on Valentineâ€™s Day in the comments, and weâ€™ll send them some love in their DMs. ðŸ˜‚ðŸ–¤
